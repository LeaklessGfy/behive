In the year 2012, Desmond Miles is kidnapped and made to relive his ancestor's memory through a machine called the Animus. As the ancestor, Alta\u00efr, players unveil an assassin conspiracy set in the middle ages.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\">Assassin's Creed was released for the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 in November 2007 and made it onto PC and Mac the following year. Assassin's Creed takes place during the Third Crusade in the year 1191 CE. As <a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"\/altair\/3005-48\">Alta\u00efr<\/a>, a member of the assassin sect Hashshashin, players travel across the holy land visiting <a data-ref-id=\"3035-446\" href=\"\/jerusalem\/3035-446\">Jerusalem<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-447\" href=\"\/acre\/3035-447\">Acre<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-445\" href=\"\/damascus\/3035-445\">Damascus<\/a> in order to find and assassinate numerous targets. All though the game focuses on Alta\u00efr's journey, the premise is instigated by a sci-fi narrative hook involving Alta\u00efr's ancestor, Desmond Miles.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13824\/410549-bb90d1fe58a6e2c82547ade4e7b238004f58f55d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410549\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13824\/410549-bb90d1fe58a6e2c82547ade4e7b238004f58f55d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-410549\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/13824\/410549-bb90d1fe58a6e2c82547ade4e7b238004f58f55d.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Messenger of the Assassins<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">In the year 2012, Desmond Miles is kidnapped by a huge corporate conglomerate known as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2653\" href=\"\/abstergo-industries\/3015-2653\">Abstergo Industries<\/a> led by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11458\" href=\"\/warren-vidic\/3005-11458\">Warren Vidic<\/a> and who influence the world from the shadows.

After Alta\u00efr sets a trap and defeats the Templar forces, he is called to assembly by Al Mualim in front of the village. He is told he only succeeded because he followed orders, and goes to refer to the Solomon's Temple incident. As punishment for this <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1134\" href=\"\/al-mualim\/3005-1134\">Al Mualim<\/a>, publicly demotes <a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"\/altair\/3005-48\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> after stabbing him, initiating his \"rebirth\" in the process. He then assigns to him nine assassination targets that he must kill throughout the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">As the game progresses Alta\u00efr becomes aware of the fact that the men he was ordered to kill are all connected through the Templars, and eventually Desmond finds out that his captors are the modern day Templars. Later on, Altair finds out that Al Mualim, his master, is also a Templar and has been using Alta\u00efr to further his own goals. Alta\u00efr confronts Al Mualim and fights with him. After defeating his master, Alta\u00efr acquires the Piece of Eden, a mythical object that can hypnotize the masses with mind control. Desmond learns that the activation of the Piece of Eden activated other pieces scattered across the globe and showing their location to him. Abstergo sets out to retrieve the Pieces. While the company initially intended to kill Desmond, a lab assistant named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2566\" href=\"\/lucy-stillman\/3005-2566\">Lucy<\/a> (who, it turns out, is really a secret member of the modern day assassin's guild) convinces them to let Desmond live. The story ends with Abstergo moving the Piece of Eden , leaving the story open for a sequel. It is also revealed that through overuse of the Animus, Desmond is able to use Altair's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6193\" href=\"\/eagle-vision\/3015-6193\">Eagle Vision<\/a> ability outside of the machine. The game ends with Desmond using his new ability to see words and characters written in blood on the walls left by a previous test subject.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/438271-141488_13_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-438271\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3699\/438271-141488_13_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-438271\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3699\/438271-141488_13_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3699\/438271-141488_13_2.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Climb everything!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Gameplay consists of climbing buildings, running across rooftops, blending in with crowds and engaging enemies in sword fights. Though it is very forgiving, Assassin's Creed is ostensibly a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-24\" href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\">stealth<\/a> game. If you are spotted by guards while acting recklessly they will get alerted and eventually give chase. Once you break the pursuing guards' line of sight you can lose them by hiding in stacks of hay that are placed around the city, ducking into rooftop gardens or sitting on a bench amongst other people. The \"Leap of Faith\" mechanic allows the player to jump from high buildings down into a haystack and stay concealed until the guards give up their search. High buildings have spots called viewpoints which the player can use to synchronize Desmond's vision with Alta\u00efr's memory. This triggers a 360 camera rotation and uncovers previously obscured objectives, on the map.<\/p><p style=\"\">The free-running and climbing mechanics are simplified in such a way that they allow the player to jump and climb by holding down the run button and automatically grab onto surfaces, creating endless momentum. Every structure in the game can be climbed except for the outer walls of cities.<\/p><p style=\"\">Other aspects of gameplay include Investigating targets. Investigations have the player performing basic tasks such as pick-pocketing, eavesdropping or intimidating individuals through the use of force to gain their knowledge. The player can blend in with designated crowds by holding down a single button. With the use of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6193\" href=\"\/eagle-vision\/3015-6193\">Eagle Vision<\/a> players can easily keep track of their target. Side missions have you completing tasks for other assassins such as collecting a succesion of flags in a rooftop race against the clock. The player can also travel from one city to the next through an area known as The Kingdom. Here, enemies are much more agressive but the player has the advantage of being on horseback allowing him to flee quickly should he get in over his head against enemies.<\/p><p style=\"\">In sword fights, Alta\u00efr can lock onto an enemy but can block incoming attacks from other foes and finish them off. If timed correctly Alta\u00efr can switched seamlessly from one enemy to the next.<\/p><h2>Structure &amp; Philosophy<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game alternates between the two timelines and its respective characters through the use of Memory Blocks. These blocks are chapters from Alta\u00efr's life that Desmond can access through synchronization but because prolonged exposure to the animus causes hallucinations (known as The Bleeding Effect) he is forced to rest in between chapters. At these designated times, players get to walk around as Desmond and explore small portions of the Abstergo Lab, get to interact with Lucy, investigate Warren Vidic''s computer or have conversations with the latter. Desmond often questions Vidic's motives and philosophical debates ensue between the two.<\/p><p style=\"\">Similarly, Alta\u00efr questions the motives of his master Al Mualim and those of his own. As the game progresses, Alta\u00efr is ordered by Al Mualim to assassinate 9 targets. All of whom, he is told, are evil and cruel and must be dealth with. Alta\u00efr becomes increasingly confused and misled by the final words of the targets he assassinates. Their words often contradict their apparent lifestyles and cruelty which leads him to question his own beliefs and morals.<\/p><h2>Hidden Blade<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23593\/2287196-altair.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2287196\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5440289505428\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/23593\/2287196-altair.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2287196\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/23593\/2287196-altair.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/23593\/2287196-altair.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3055-962\" href=\"\/hidden-blade\/3055-962\">hidden blade<\/a> is a weapon conceived for silent assassination and has been employed by the Brotherhood of Assassin's for centuries. Concealed under the wearer sleeve and strapped under the forearm, its mechanism allows the blade to be extended and retracted. In Alta\u00efr's days, assassins had their ring finger removed in order for the blade to extend properly. In the game, players can approach targets from behind and employ the hidden blade for silent assassinations. It is equally possible to assassinate the target up front but this arouses suspicion more quickly. Nearby guards will investigate the situation or chase the player down to engage him in combat.<\/p><h2>Voice Talents<\/h2><ul><li>Philip Shahbaz ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"\/altair\/3005-48\">Alta\u00efr ibn La-Ahad<\/a><\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-90887\" href=\"\/kristen-bell\/3040-90887\">Kristen Bell<\/a> ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2566\" href=\"\/lucy-stillman\/3005-2566\">Lucy Stillman<\/a><\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\" href=\"\/nolan-north\/3040-80008\">Nolan North<\/a> ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-305\" href=\"\/desmond-miles\/3005-305\">Desmond Miles<\/a> \/ Abbas<\/b><\/li><li>Phil Proctor ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-11458\" href=\"\/warren-vidic\/3005-11458\">Warren Vidic<\/a><\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-51968\" href=\"\/peter-renaday\/3040-51968\">Peter Renaday<\/a> ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-1134\" href=\"\/al-mualim\/3005-1134\">Al Mualim<\/a><\/b><\/li><li>Haaz Sleiman ... <b>Malik A-Sayf<\/b><\/li><li>Alain Benatar ... <b>Acre Bureau Leader<\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-63567\" href=\"\/carlos-ferro\/3040-63567\">Carlos Ferro<\/a> ... <b>Damascus Bureau Leader<\/b><\/li><li>Jean-Philippe Dandenaud ... <b>Robert de Sable<\/b><\/li><li>Ammar Daraiseh ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-17215\" href=\"\/tamir\/3005-17215\">Tamir<\/a><\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-86819\" href=\"\/hubert-fielden\/3040-86819\">Hubert Fielden<\/a> ... <b>Garnier De Naplouse<\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-85890\" href=\"\/jake-eberle\/3040-85890\">Jake Eberle<\/a> ... <b>Talal<\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-7777\" href=\"\/harry-standjofski\/3040-7777\">Harry Standjofski<\/a> ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-12491\" href=\"\/william-of-montferrat\/3005-12491\">William of Montferrat<\/a><\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-63568\" href=\"\/fred-tatasciore\/3040-63568\">Fred Tatasciore<\/a> ... <b>Jubair Al-Hakim \/ Abu'l Nuooud<\/b><\/li><li>Richard Cansino ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3005-12493\" href=\"\/majd-addin\/3005-12493\">Majd Addin<\/a><\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-86821\" href=\"\/arthur-holden\/3040-86821\">Arthur Holden<\/a> ... <b>Sibrand<\/b><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3040-86822\" href=\"\/eleanor-noble\/3040-86822\">Eleanor Noble<\/a> ... <b>Maria<\/b><\/li><li>Marcel Jeannin ... <b>Richard the Lionheart<\/b><\/li><li>Jennifer Seguin ... <b><a data-ref-id=\"3055-359\" href=\"\/animus\/3055-359\">Animus<\/a><\/b><\/li><\/ul><h2>Press<\/h2><p style=\"\">Assassin's Creed divided the press as one of the holiday's more anticipated titles. Some outlets (such as GameSpot) hailed it to be an extraordinary game and gave it \"Triple-A\" scores. Others believed that it was quite average and repetitive, and had been over-hyped by a manufactured press cycle. Scores ran the gamut with Assassin's Creed receiving 10s from some print outlets all the way down to a 4.5 from one of the three reviewers in Electronic Gaming Monthly. The game has an average of 80 on Metacritic, ranking it as an above-average title. The game similarly divided gamers, and the game's validity as a great product is still hotly debated.<\/p><h3>Sales<\/h3><p style=\"\">The initial release of Assassin's Creed has done very well for Ubisoft selling millions of copies and spawning a spin-off game for the DS. Ubisoft was surprised by the sales and released this statement:<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\">\"Assassin's Creed has greatly out-stripped Ubisoft's sales expectations and currently ranks among the top two or three best-selling games for the PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system and Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system in the vast majority of geographical regions. In less than four weeks Assassin's Creed recorded more than two and a half million units in sell-through sales worldwide, and is the fastest-selling new video game intellectual property ever in the U.S. Consequently, Ubisoft now forecasts that it will sell a minimum of five million units of the game in 2007\u201308 compared with its previous estimate of approximately three million.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5613\" href=\"\/assassins-creed-altairs-chronicles\/3030-5613\">spin-off for the DS<\/a> serves as a prequel to Alta\u00efr's adventure in the console version. The game has also received recognition from <a data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\" href=\"\/hideo-kojima\/3040-63395\">Hideo Kojima<\/a> and the team responsible for <a data-ref-id=\"3025-5\" href=\"\/metal-gear\/3025-5\">Metal Gear Solid<\/a>, who have added a version of Alta\u00efr's costume as an unlockable bonus in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\" href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\/3030-20669\">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots<\/a>. Ubisoft stated their desire to iterate on the franchise which came in the form of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22928\" href=\"\/assassins-creed-ii\/3030-22928\">Assassin's Creed II<\/a> and the games after it.<\/p><p style=\"\">A <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"\/psp\/3045-18\">PSP<\/a> exclusive version was released on November 17th 2009, titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25423\" href=\"\/assassins-creed-bloodlines\/3030-25423\">Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines<\/a>. The story once again follows the exploits of Alta\u00efr and picks up right where the console version left off. This time, however, players will be in control of Alta\u00efr only and won't have to bother with Desmond's role. Given the nature of the PSPs size the game won't encompass sprawling cities like its big brother console version. Instead players will guide Alta\u00efr to the island of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2908\" href=\"\/cyprus\/3035-2908\">Cyprus<\/a> as he attempts to dispatch all the high commanders of the Templars to drive them away.<\/p><p style=\"\">A <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\">PC<\/a> only \"Director's Cut Edition\" was released and it included several added mission types that didn't make it into the final version of the game.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><ul><li>In the opening cinematic, Alta\u00efr used a crossbow that was originally going to be a weapon in his arsenal throughout the game, but was replaced in favor of the throwing knives in the final build due to historical inaccuracies.<\/li><li>The game's timeline is around two months long, from July (after the Crusader victory in the siege of Acre) to early September (just before the battle of Arsuf).<\/li><li>The phrase used by the Assassins, \"La'shai sahih bel kullu shai'n mumkin,\" is Arabic for \"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.\" This is most likely from the 11th century Persian missionary Hassan-i Sabbah.<\/li><li>Al Mualim, Alta\u00efr's mentor throughout the game, is most likely based on Rashid ad-Din Sinan, a real person who allegedly ordered two botched assassination attempts on Saladin, the ruler of Syria and Egypt at the time.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Origins<\/h2><p style=\"\">Alta\u00efr's first name is derived from an Arabic word related to \u201cflying\u201d or \u201cthe bird\u201d.

Unbeknownst to the other Assassins, his consciousness is confronted with a challenge by the Animus and the \"digital ghost\" of <a href=\"\/subject-16\/3005-13227\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13227\"> Subject 16<\/a>; Desmond must relive one last experience from the life of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, in order to reconstruct his fractured mind and awaken from his coma. It is revealed that the primary problem is that Desmond was already on the brink of going insane because of the crossover in his mind between his own memories and those of Ezio and their mutual ancestor Altair Ibn la-Ahad. In order to seperate their memories from his own and save himself, Desmond must synchronize his mind with a \"key memory\" that actually connects himself, Altair and Ezio together. Desmond begins reliving Ezio's later life in which he questions his life as an Assassin and how his life would've been had he made different decisions.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ezio embarks on a spiritual journey to <a href=\"\/masyaf\/3035-1100\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1100\"> Masyaf<\/a> in a journey of self-discovery. Upon arrival, he discovers that Masyaf has been conquered by <a href=\"\/knights-templar\/3015-2655\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2655\"> Templars<\/a>. Upon infiltration of Masyaf, Ezio finds an ancient library chamber which can only be opened by five seals hidden in the ancient Ottoman city of <a href=\"\/constantinople\/3035-3680\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3680\"> Constantinople<\/a>. Within Constantinople, he finds a Templar threat forming in the region, threatening to destabilize it, and must defeat it as he defeated the Borgia in the past in order to both recover the seals and bring peace to Turkey. At the same time, the seals themselves are made of ancient technology like the Pieces of Eden; using them allows Ezio to relive the memories of Altair in much the same way that the Animus allows Desmond to relive the memories of Ezio.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the end, Ezio unlocks the library room with the seals, and discovers that in truth, it is not a library, but a tomb; the final resting place of Altair, who sealed himself in with a Piece of Eden and a sixth seal showing his final moments. At this moment, the key memory takes place; standing in front of the body of Altair, Ezio turns and addresses Desmond, whom he somehow senses is watching him from centuries in the future, expressing his hope that Desmond will be able to find the answers to the questions that eluded Ezio during his lifetime. With his mind repaired, Desmond is contacted by Jupiter, one of The Ones Who Came Before, who gives him a grim vision of the end of the previous Human civilization, a doomsday which is rapidly approaching again, before giving Desmond another vision, of the location of a secret cache of technology, failed attempts to prevent the end of days, which the Assassins can hopefully use to save mankind. At this, Desmond awakens, and tells his friends he knows what he needs to do, only for them to reveal that they also somehow knew about it, and have taken him to the location while he was unconscious.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\"><b>Assassin's Creed: Revelations<\/b> plays similarly to its predecessors, evolving the current formula, as well as presenting new gameplay additions. New features include:<\/p><ul><li>Ezio is now in possession of a Hookblade. This hookblade is not only usable in close combat to pull enemies in but also allows him to use various zipwires scattered throughout the city and make corner chase breaker movements.<\/li><li>A new crafting system has been implemented into the game which will allow players to craft over three hundred types of bombs from 3 categories: lethal, tactical and diversion. Ezio can carry up to 15 bombs.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/eagle-vision\/3015-6193\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6193\"> Eagle Vision<\/a> is now 'Eagle Sense.' It will allow you to focus on a particular character and is described as: \"You'll get an approximation of where he will go. If you're able to detect the path a guard will take, you can run ahead, set a bomb, and create a trap or an ambush.\"<\/li><li>Assassins' Dens will act as the new 'Borgia Towers.' These dens are placed throughout the city and the player will need to complete set tasks in order to overthrow the Templar influence before they can use the den. Ubisoft have said that there will be a larger variety of methods\/tasks that will allow the player to take these dens. Once a player is in control of a den they will be able to refurbish buildings in the region as well as set the behaviour of guards. In addition to this, players will be able to set a 'Master Assassin' to control the den so that they absolutely cannot be taken by the Templar. If you are unable to make it to a den that is currently under attack, you will be able to send your assassin recruits to defend it.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">Similar to <i><\/i><i>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood<\/i>, this game features a multiplayer component.

The game concentrates heavily on the history and storytelling that the other games in the series are known for, providing players a chance to explore the \"truth\" behind historical events and characters in the series.

To reach full synchronization on a memory, players must repeat the same event several times. To keep continuity, the dialog about the event changes with each successful completion, making it seem more like a series of events rather than a continuously repeated one. Completing events rewards\u00a0the player with florins (money), XP and items. The amount of AP available to the player is dependent on the level of their character, and AP is regenerated consistently over time (1 AP every two minutes.)<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>Some events may require these items to complete. While some items need only be bought or found once, others are consumable and will be taken out of the players inventory when used.

Ezio is in a vault beneath the Vatican speaking to Minerva. Despite having many questions, she disappears and Ezio is left bewildered. He returns to where he had left the Pope who has since escaped. Ezio attempts to take the Papal staff that retracts into the ground, and he is left with only the Apple of Eden. Mario arrives and together they escape the Vatican. Right before escaping though, Ezio hesitates to get rid of the apple so no one will ever be able to harness its power but decides not to.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game flashes to 2012 where <a data-ref-id=\"3005-305\" href=\"\/desmond-miles\/3005-305\">Desmond<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2566\" href=\"\/lucy-stillman\/3005-2566\">Lucy<\/a> and the gang are on the run from Abstergo.

As Caterina and Ezio lie in bed, a giant cannon ball comes crashing through the room, nearly killing them. Ezio barely has time to realize that his beautiful manor is being attacked by Cesare Borgia. Despite his grandest efforts, the Borgia pierce the walls and capture Mario and Caterina. As Ezio races to save them, he is shot in the shoulder, Mario is executed, and the apple is taken. Ezio drags himself back to the manor, where he manages to escape through an underground crypt with his mother and sister thanks to a man with an eyepatch who fends off the troops. As the rest of the surviving Auditore family go to a safe house, Ezio decides to ride a horse for Rome to get the apple back. As Ezio rides, he collapses from loss of blood and passes out.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ezio wakes up in a house in Rome, healed and with his assassin gear. It's made unclear on who brought him to the house but he decides to go meet Machiavelli. Rome is under Borgia rule. Many shops are closed and martial law is in effect, with soldiers patrolling everywhere. The Borgia have everyone in their pocket, from the military to the church. Ezio wishes to make a difference, inciting a rebellion against the Borgia and give Rome back to the Romans. Ezio decides that the only way to do this is with allies. He gains the trust of La Volpe (thieves guild), the courtesans and Bartolomeo (mercenaries guild) and things begin to take shape.<\/p><p style=\"\">The allies decide that Ezio must assassinate Cesare Borgia to eliminate the oppression. Ezio doesn't think that eliminating the Borgia will solve anything but decides to take the mission anyways to save Caterina who's being held at the Vatican in Castle Gandolfo. There, he misses Cesare but meets Lucrezia Borgia, Cesare's sister and lover. He manages to save Caterina who returns to Forli and spares Lucrezia. Ezio decides to orchestrate a plan to remove corruption from Rome. By helping out the citizens of Roma, he brings Assassins to his cause. He decides that the only way to destroy Cesare Borgia is to cut off different elements starting with funding.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ezio manages to kill Cesare's banker by killing him in the middle of an orgy. Cesare is using the French to enact military pressure on Rome and the final non-corrupt institutions. Ezio kills the French general (Baron de Valois) guaranteeing that Rome stays Roman. Ezio chooses to take down the Pope as he is a centerpiece to the Borgia empire. By manipulating information, the Borgia begin to turn on each other. Ezio orchestrates one final attack on Castel Gondolfo.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33529\/1524371-996092_20100614_790screen011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524371\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.56329113924051\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/33529\/1524371-996092_20100614_790screen011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1524371\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/33529\/1524371-996092_20100614_790screen011.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/33529\/1524371-996092_20100614_790screen011.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The new combat mechanics in action.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Cesare meets with the Pope inside the castle.

Disgusted, Cesare takes the poisoned apple, sticks it into the pope's face and chokes him to death. In the meantime, Lucrezia shows up and in his rage, Cesare tells her that he never loved her. This only makes Ezio's job easier as Lucrezia tells him where the Apple is hidden. Ezio finds the apple and brings it back to the assassin hideout on Tiber Island. There, he is made Master of Assassins and uses the power of the apple to squash the remains of Cesare Borgia's empire. Cesare is eventually arrested but flees to Spain.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game skips ahead to the previously inaccessible Sequence 9. There, Ezio finally kills Cesare by throwing him off the top of a castle. Ezio then goes back to Rome and hides the Apple of Eden in a vault beneath the Coliseum. Having discovered its location, the crew drive out to Rome to get it.<\/p><p style=\"\">After solving several puzzles, Desmond and Lucy make it to the Apple. Desmond meets Juno a hologram of \"those who came before\" that explains the history of the two race of creatures. The holograms of Juno around the vault seem to be hostile against Lucy, claiming that she is not who she seems to be. When Desmond touches the Apple, everything freezes and he loses control of his body. As the spirits yell that she must be eliminated, Desmond unwillingly takes out his hidden blade and stabs Lucy. The screen fades to black and the credits roll.<\/p><h3>Subject 16<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/93538\/1639837-brotherhoodsubject16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639837\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 311px\" data-ratio=\"1.6720257234727\" data-width=\"311\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/9\/93538\/1639837-brotherhoodsubject16.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1639837\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/93538\/1639837-brotherhoodsubject16.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/9\/93538\/1639837-brotherhoodsubject16.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Subject 16<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">There are 10 clusters hidden around the game world that have been placed there by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13227\" href=\"\/subject-16\/3005-13227\">Subject 16<\/a>.

It is unclear if Subject 16 is still alive in the real world or if he just programmed himself into the Animus.

After some complications, you travel to Rome to build a guild of assassins. Each <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1321\" href=\"\/assassin\/3015-1321\">assassin<\/a> has to be recruited individually, equipped and trained through sending them on missions throughout Europe. The trainees are recruited through missions where you save them, but are easily lost if you are not careful. Otherwise all (or almost all) gameplay elements from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22928\" href=\"\/assassins-creed-ii\/3030-22928\">Assassin's Creed II<\/a> return for the sequel. Additions this time around are the ability to ride inside a city and fight from a horse. NPC characters are also able to ride this time around and can be assassinated even when they are on their horses.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/1470513-acbrother4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470513\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/1470513-acbrother4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470513\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/1470513-acbrother4.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/1470513-acbrother4.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ezio fighting a soldier on horseback!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The crossbow - which has been teased since the intro FMV to the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2950\" href=\"\/assassins-creed\/3030-2950\">Assassin's Creed<\/a> - is finally introduced to the series, and functions similarly to the hidden gun; while the crossbow has more ammo available, it is ineffective against armored enemies, where the gun can easily take down an armored guard. However, the crossbow can be used to silently eliminate guards.<\/p><p style=\"\">Another notable refinement is the inclusion of the hidden gun into combat. Players are now able to hold down the attack button for a moment to aim and fire the gun, rather than breaking out to a menu to select and equip it as in the previous game. The gun is also used in several of Ezio's execution attacks.<\/p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-3202\" href=\"\/leonardo-da-vinci\/3005-3202\">Leonardo Da Vinci<\/a> returns to the game, and is once again in the business of helping Ezio expand his arsenal. Leonardo has been drafted by the Borgia and forced to invent weaponry for them. Take on a range of missions to destroy, disable, and otherwise sabotage these new weapons, and he will help Ezio by providing new gadgets like a dart gun in his hidden blade and a parachute that can be used to both break falls and improve mobility.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unlike AC2, you can replay memories. Each memory has a particular goal to meet, such as not being detected, not being hit, or not touching the ground over the course of the mission. Meeting these goals will improve Desmond's synchronization to Ezio; however, the player will not fail the memory if they aren't met.<\/p><h3>Locations<\/h3><p style=\"\">The game is set entirely in Rome, which is massive in scope and includes both city and countryside. Ezio cannot leave the city or the country, but he can send his assassin recruits all over Europe to complete missions.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Assassin tombs have returned from AC II, although they are now associated with the Followers of Romulus, rather than the Assassins.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p style=\"\">The multiplayer of Assassins Creed Brotherhood focuses on trying to kill other players through disguise and tricks. Players select from a number of different player models, and then every NPC will have one of those player models. The players themselves attempt to kill a target while escaping from another, with certain game modes changing the balance of escaping and killing. Players are encouraged to use stealth by standing near similar player models or disguising, or smart attacks like attacking from a rooftop onto an unsuspecting target below.<\/p><h3>Game Modes<\/h3><p style=\"\"><b>Wanted<\/b> - Features up to 8 players. Each player in the match has a target, meaning that everyone has someone to kill and someone that is trying to kill them.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Manhunt<\/b> - Features up to 8 players. Everyone is divided into two teams of four. The Hunters (all consisting of the same character model) must kill the Hunted team (all consisting of the same character model as well). After the first round, the team's switch.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Alliance<\/b> - Features up to 6 players. 3 teams of 2 are assigned another team as their target, functioning similarly to Wanted.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Advanced Wanted<\/b> - A more difficult version of Wanted. The compass is less precise (goes farther away from your target) and no longer shows your target's height.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Advanced Alliance -<\/b> A more difficult version of Alliance. The compass is less precise (goes farther away from your target) and no longer shows your target's height.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Chest Capture-<\/b> Features up to 8 players. 2 teams of four are assigned two tasks. One team defends 3 chests that are spawned at random locations, while the other team simultaneously tries to rob the chests. Similar to Manhunt, it is based around a 2 round increment. After each round, teams swap.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Escort:<\/b> Added in the Animus 1.2 update. Unique NPCs with a specific model roam the map; the attackers can only kill the NPC or stun the defenders. The defenders can only kill the attackers.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Assassinate:<\/b> Added in the Animus 1.2 update. This is the equivalent to complete FFA deathmatch. You are not given a target, but instead lock onto personas in order to gain a contract on them. You are not told if you are locking onto a player or an NPC, and can only rely on your detection skills to pick out another player instead of an NPC. If you know that an enemy is stalking you, then you can also declare them your target to create a \"stalemate\" situation, where you both lose your contract against each other, and cannot reacquire the same person as a contract for some time.<\/p><h3>Abilities<\/h3><p style=\"\">All abilities have cooldown times and are activated with the press of a button. In addition, the player will unlock advanced forms of different abilities as they level up.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Ability Name<\/th><th>Level Required<\/th><th>Description<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Disguise<\/b><\/td><td>Level 2<\/td><td>Changes the player into a random character model.

This machine lets him relive past experiences as his ancestors through genetic memory. In the first game you played as Alta\u00efr. The narrative then follows the exploits of Ezio, an Italian noble who is betrayed by the rival ruling families of Italy. Educated in poetry, and art, as well as trained in the art of swordplay and war, Ezio is both a scholar and a warrior. He is not, however, an assassin, although he finds himself moving down that path as he is faced with betrayal and murder.<\/p><p style=\"\">Over the arc of the story, many historical figures will find their way into the narrative, including the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10830\" href=\"\/lorenzo-de-medici\/3005-10830\">Medici<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3202\" href=\"\/leonardo-da-vinci\/3005-3202\">Leonardo Da Vinci<\/a> (his friend and supporter), and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10829\" href=\"\/niccolo-machiavelli\/3005-10829\">Machiavelli<\/a>.

He hails from Florence, Italy and has blood ties to Altair, as well as Desmond Miles, the modern-day protagonist in the first game. Assassin's Creed II is set in 1476 in Italy, and similar to the original game, the second iteration of the series will feature an over world, and will include locations such as Saint Mark's Basilica Cathedral, The Grand Canal, Rialto Bridge, and Da Vinci's Workshop. The city states of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2112\" href=\"\/florence\/3035-2112\">Florence<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1825\" href=\"\/venice-italy\/3035-1825\">Venice<\/a>, Romagna, and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2113\" href=\"\/tuscany\/3035-2113\">Tuscany<\/a> are the setting of Ezio's journey.<\/p><p style=\"\">Unlike the first game where Alta\u00efr was more of a lone soldier, Ezio this time has a sort of family helping him out. That is to say you can recruit people, or you can use family members placed on the streets, and have them be diversions or hide dead bodies. They can even help you out while fighting, and will join, when they think it's necessary. Your allies are into 3 guilds you will ally with through the game, The Mercenaries Guild, The Thieves Guild and Courtestans. The mercenaries are used for battle, the courtesans for distraction and the thieves for both.<\/p><p style=\"\">The structure from Assassin's Creed where you would go out investigate, kill your target and return back to your master has been scrapped. You can now take on the missions in different ways. There are 15 individual mission types this time, however, the developers can combine the mission types all into one, creating a completely new way you must play. At E3, the developers stated that they had roughly 200 unique mission types. Also the AI is now more ruthless. It can remember you, and will investigate if it thinks it knows you. To make it a little more difficult on enemy guards, however, players have the option of buying different outfits to disguise themselves. Various capes and dyes will also help you pull off different looks, making it that much harder for the AI to find you.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1202198-double_assassination.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202198\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1202198-double_assassination.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1202198\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1202198-double_assassination.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1202198-double_assassination.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Thanks to Leonardo, Ezio uses TWO hidden blades<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Ezio, unlike Altair, wields dual <a data-ref-id=\"3055-962\" href=\"\/hidden-blade\/3055-962\">hidden blades<\/a>, a new and useful tool. Another new addition is the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2972\" href=\"\/disarm\/3015-2972\">disarm<\/a> technique; Ezio can disarm an enemy and take the newly acquired weapon as his own (until the weapon is dropped by selecting a weapon carried in the inventory). This is especially useful for the better armored and skilled blocker opponents. Strong enemies are also capable of disarming Ezio by knocking weapons out of his hand; the weapon will fall to the ground and can be picked up again, but if it is left forgotten Ezio must return to his Villa's war room to reequip the same weapon. He also has a wrist gun hidden under his sleeve where his double hidden blades are, and can obtain and use several different weapons from shops. Available weapons include: <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1\" href=\"\/sword\/3055-1\">swords<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1306\" href=\"\/dagger\/3055-1306\">daggers<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-573\" href=\"\/spear\/3055-573\">spears<\/a> (after disarming an opponent), <a data-ref-id=\"3055-729\" href=\"\/war-hammer\/3055-729\">war hammers<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2214\" href=\"\/battle-axe\/3055-2214\">battle axes<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-724\" href=\"\/mace\/3055-724\">maces<\/a>. You may also use weapons like brooms gained from citizens. These all tie in to the updated combat mechanic in the game, which blends elements of the system from the first game, such as counters and parries, and implements them in the more fluid, realistic combat system of Assassins Creed II.<\/p><p style=\"\">The developers aim to create a system that makes Ezio feel more like an assassin than a Warrior, encouraging the use of quick take downs over prolonged engagements with guards. To reinforce this feeling, Ezio will for the most part no longer carry any set weapon issued to him by a superior. The player can buy and upgrade weapons and items at shops, letting Ezio keep them constantly in his inventory and war room storage. The enemies Ezio will face have also been expanded upon so that now he will be forced to contend with both heavily armored guards, spear soldiers, swordsmen, and lightly armored foes wielding lighter weapons.<\/p><p style=\"\">Ezio's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-130\" href=\"\/health\/3015-130\">health<\/a> no longer regenerates to the same extent, and although syncing will restore some health, players must consult street doctors or use medicine for more serious wounds. Hiding spots are no longer a guaranteed escape, as there is a new AI class-type named the seeker who can see through hiding spots. He can poke Ezio with his spear to draw him out of cover. You may still counter his attacks while inside cover. Assassin's Creed II also adds the ability to swim, which proves useful in the canals of Venice. Another notable ability is being able to assassinate enemies from hiding spots, such as hay bails.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3439\/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948875\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.78217821782178\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3439\/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948875\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3439\/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3439\/948875-ac2_teaser_detail_2.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Re-Worked Assassin Symbol<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Other new features include a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-92\" href=\"\/daynight-cycle\/3015-92\">day and night cycle<\/a> and a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2973\" href=\"\/notoriety-system\/3015-2973\">notoriety system<\/a> in which Ezio will become recognized as he takes on more quests in each town; higher notoriety will result in civilians and guards becoming increasingly wary of the player's movements. This level of notoriety will be set within each city, so that while the player may be completely unknown in some cities, he may be infamous in others. The player may take on quests to bribe or kill informants and remove wanted posters in order to decrease his notoriety level, however some capes drop your notoriety in some cites. There are also many hidden items scattered throughout the world like the first Assassin's Creed. These include Gold Coins, Flags and mini statues. This time, however, collecting these items will unlock concrete bonuses: new items and rewards for players instead of just gamerpoints.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are fifteen mission types in Assassin's Creed II, a large increase over the number in the original, as there are now over 200 missions in Assassin's Creed II. Also changed is the fact that, upon entering the city, the player will not be forced to repeat the same side quests, in the same order, for each assassination, as they did in the first game. However, they have removed the passive quests of the older missions like eavesdropping or pick pocketing. Different mission types may be linked in a single quest: a robbery may turn into a chase, which may then turn into an assassination.<\/p><p style=\"\">Another feature is an all new <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2425\" href=\"\/economy\/3015-2425\">economic system<\/a>. Ezio is a rich nobleman and that's where the system comes into play. Along with the ability to pick-pocket people in the game to take their money, you can use that money to buy weapons and ammunition. <a data-ref-id=\"3055-574\" href=\"\/armor\/3055-574\">Armor<\/a> is available for purchase, as well as clothing dye to customize Ezio's outfit. You can also use the money to hire thieves and street hookers, if you didn't become friends with them before, for assistance in an assassination plot. To Increase your economic, you spend money to renovate Monteriggionni, giving you increased income per 20 minutes.<\/p><p style=\"\">Desmond Miles is given less screen time but more abilities than in the first game.

It features a brand new playable character (<a href=\"\/connor-kenway\/3005-22428\" data-ref-id=\"3005-22428\">Connor Kenway<\/a>) in a brand new time period and environment (North America during the American Revolutionary war). It's also the conclusion of Desmond Mile's story. The game also features multiplayer and <a href=\"\/uplay\/3015-4289\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4289\">Uplay<\/a> connectivity.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game was released on October 30th, 2012 on all major consoles (<a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> and <a href=\"\/wii-u\/3045-139\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U<\/a> versions were released a month later), receiving critical acclaim.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Overview<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5207\/2337453-screenshot_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337453\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5207\/2337453-screenshot_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337453\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5207\/2337453-screenshot_19.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Combat makes up a large part of the gameplay.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Assassin's Creed 3 is a third-person action game with elements of <a href=\"\/parkour\/3015-272\" data-ref-id=\"3015-272\">parkour<\/a> and <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a>. The game focuses on sneaking around as well as combat. The player spends most of the game playing as Connor, an able bodied assassin who's skilled with tomahawks, his bow, as well as the assassins' signature weapons, the <a href=\"\/hidden-blade\/3055-962\" data-ref-id=\"3055-962\">hidden blades<\/a>. The game's combat works around a three button system where players can choose to either counter an enemy, strike an enemy, or break the defense of an enemy. Combos and counters are different depending on the weapon wielded by Connor. Aiming and shooting with a gun or the bow is handled through both auto aim and the manual aiming depending on the situation. Many of Connor's attacks are also context sensitive. For example, with the series' iconic hidden blade, Connor will discretely stab an enemy when in stealth, leap in the air to stab an enemy to the ground while running, or perform a variety of slashes while in open combat.<\/p><p style=\"\">Much like other games in the series, AC 3 gives players the ability to sneak their way around the environment. Connor can hide in a variety of places such as hay bales, bushes, or crowds. Open doors and windows make for speedy escapes through buildings, while the new rope dart lets players reel enemies in from a distance. Enemy awareness is indicated via a cone over their heads that progressively fills as long as Connor is visible. The more Connor provokes the enemy factions by killing their troops, the more wanted he'll become. This means that, if pushed far enough, enemy troops will attack Connor on sight. Wanted levels can be decreased by bribing town criers, tearing down wanted posters, or paying to stop the production of wanted posters altogether. When the enemy is in pursuit, Connor must become incognito by hiding, or escape the area entirely.<\/p><h3>Naval Gameplay<\/h3><p style=\"\">AC 3 introduces naval gameplay where Connor serves as the captain of a <a href=\"\/ship\/3055-929\" data-ref-id=\"3055-929\">ship<\/a> waging war off the coast of colonial America, or in the Caribbean. Sailing is done according to wind currents which dictate how fast the Connor's ship goes. Connor can choose how much the sails on the ship are unfurled. Going full sail increases speed while going half sail lowers speed but increases maneuverability. Combat is fought using the ship's cannons and swivel guns. The cannons allow for high damage along the broadside of the ship, but cannot be aimed independently of the ship's orientation.The swivel guns can be aimed freely but do not do enough damage to harm larger ships unless a weak spot is exposed. The ship can be upgraded with increased firepower, different types of ammo, more health, and more.<\/p><h3>The Environment<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/16\/164828\/2339159-tumblr_mbefx2piet1qdqlkxo9_250.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2339159\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 250px\" data-ratio=\"0.552\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/16\/164828\/2339159-tumblr_mbefx2piet1qdqlkxo9_250.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2339159\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/16\/164828\/2339159-tumblr_mbefx2piet1qdqlkxo9_250.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Hunter or hunted?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Assassin's Creed 3 introduces new environmental hazards in the form of wildlife. Most of the wildlife consists of hare, raccoon, deer, and other harmless hunting targets. However <a href=\"\/bears\/3015-1848\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1848\">bears<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wolf\/3015-2265\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2265\">wolves<\/a>, and other predators stalk the frontier. The game offers hunting gameplay where Connor is encouraged to skin and gut all the different kinds of animals in the different hunting areas (skinning animations are entirely skippable). Hunting makes up for a large part of the game. Players can set up snares and bait animals. The quality and type of bounty is determined by the way in which the animal is killed, with snares and the <a href=\"\/hidden-blade\/3055-962\" data-ref-id=\"3055-962\">hidden blade<\/a> providing the most intact, and lucrative reward. Rewards from hunting can be sold, or used for crafting on the Homestead.<\/p><p style=\"\">Connor is much more mobile than previous Assassin's Creed protagonists. In addition to standard city parkour, Connor is able to climb up trees, jump across branches, and scale rocky cliffs. The environment changes as time progresses both in gameplay, and in the story. Snow can blanket the ground during winter months, while a dynamic weather system can cause rain at any time.. Synchronization points are also present in the game, usually represented as the tallest building in a district or the tallest tree in an area. Finding a synchronization point reveals all hidden objects on the map in that area.<\/p><h3>Liberation Gameplay<\/h3><p style=\"\">AC 3 is set in two major cities: Boston and New York. Each city is initially under Templar control. Districts of the city can be liberated by completing side missions such as killing Templar targets or putting down rabid disease spreading dogs. Once Connor has completed all of these side missions in a district, a Liberation Contract is unlocked. These missions introduce Connor to new Assassin Recruits for his guild and give him new recruit abilities to make use of.<\/p><h3>Assassin's Guild<\/h3><p style=\"\">The assassin's guild system makes a return, giving Connor access to a variety of assassin recruits that he can command. The recruits can be commanded to perform a multitide of tasks. Connor can command them to assassinate a target, either up close or from afar. They can dress up as Redcoats with Connor as their prisoner to allow him to infiltrate heavily guarded areas. They can start riots to distract guards, and much more. Connor can also send his assassin recruits on their own missions. Completing missions rewards the recruits with experience to rank up to improve their skills and equipment. Completing missions also rewards Connor with money and items for crafting and trade.<\/p><h3>The Homestead<\/h3><p style=\"\">The Homestead is Connor's main base of operations. From there he can perform a variety of helpful actions. Connor can conduct crafting and trade to increase his income, or gain access special weapons and upgrades. He can complete Homestead missions to attract new craftsman to his land, and improve the variety of items they can create. The Homestead acts as Connor's armory, allowing him to change his wardrobe and weapon choices. The Homestead also acts a repository for all of the trophies that Connor receives for completing various tasks and can be viewed by walking around his house and interacting with them.<\/p><h3>Collectibles<\/h3><p style=\"\">Hidden objects such as feathers make a return in the game as well as chests which must be lock picked via a minigame. There are also a few new collectibles. Pages of Benjamin Franklin's Almanac are floating around both New York and Boston. As Connor collects these pages, he unlocks new recipes for a selection of colonial era inventions for decoration at the Homestead. Peg Leg trinkets are scattered throughout the colonies and can be exchanged for information on the location of buried treasure.<\/p><h2><b>Characters<\/b><\/h2><p style=\"\">The series' habit of incorporating historical figures into their story-lines returns with full strength, as <a href=\"\/george-washington\/3005-2194\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2194\">George Washington<\/a>, General Charles Lee, <a href=\"\/benjamin-franklin\/3005-3630\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3630\">Benjamin Franklin<\/a> and more are involved in the plot of the game. Throughout the course of the story, players also play as a young Connor, series protagonist <a href=\"\/desmond-miles\/3005-305\" data-ref-id=\"3005-305\">Desmond Miles<\/a>, and Connor's father Haytham.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\">Assassin's Creed III begins where Assassin's Creed: Revelations left off as Desmond and the other Assassins locate the temple hinted at in the ending of the earlier game. Once inside, Desmond is sent back in the <a href=\"\/animus\/3055-359\" data-ref-id=\"3055-359\">Animus<\/a> to continue his training and to attempt to locate some answers as to the temple's mysteries.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/133523\/2356376-haytham.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2356376\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/133523\/2356376-haytham.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2356376\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/133523\/2356376-haytham.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/133523\/2356376-haytham.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Haytham<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Animus puts him in the shoes of <a href=\"\/haytham-kenway\/3005-24791\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24791\">Haytham Kenway<\/a>, a London-based assassin, in the year 1753. After acquiring a mysterious amulet through assassination, Haytham is tasked with locating a First Civilization ruin in the American colonies. After an eventful boatride, Haytham arrives in Boston, where he is greeted by <a href=\"\/charles-lee\/3005-24804\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24804\">Charles Lee<\/a>, an officer under General Braddock of the British army. Haytham is revered by Charles, who one day hopes to join the order to which Haytham belongs. Following a list he was given back in England, Haytham locates and brings together several like-minded individuals and begins his search for the ruins of the First Civilization by befriending native tribes.<\/p><p style=\"\">Haytham learns that a native tribe, the Mohawk, have been oppressed by a slaver. As a gesture of good faith, Haytham rescues several enslaved natives and kills the slaver. This brings him into contact with a native woman named Kaniehti:io (Ziio), who he uses as a primary conduit with the natives in the region. Haytham learns that General Braddock has been planning to drive Ziio's people away and forms a plan to ambush Braddock as he leads an expedition against the French. Allied with several native tribes, Haytham leads the assault and personally executes Braddock. This is sufficient to gain Ziio's trust, and she takes him to their only known First Civilization ruin. Haytham attempts to gain access to the ruin using the amulet, but is unable to do so. Distraught, Haytham and Ziio share a passionate moment in the temple.<\/p><p style=\"\">Following this, Haytham calls a meeting with all the men he had recruited and begins an induction ceremony for Charles. It is at this point that it is revealed that Haytham is in fact a Templar, and not an assassin as previously assumed.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Animus then focuses on Ziio, who is revealed to have been carrying Haytham's child. She names the boy Ratonhnhaketon. Then the game changes to the perspective of Ratonhnhaketon as he is going to play with his friends. As he is playing hide and seek with his friends he is grabbed from his hiding place by Charles Lee who talks and then Ratonhnhaketon asks Charles Lee \"What is your name?\" he replies with \"Charles Lee, why?\" then Ratonhnhaketon says \"So I can find you\" he is then knocked out. He then awakes and returns to his village to find that it is on fire he goes through the village to find his mother trapped in the fire and tries to save her she then tells him to go and says that she will always be with him. He is pulled out of the fire as the roof collapses, then time jumps a few years and Ratonhnhaketon is now a teen and out teaching his friend to hunt and climb trees.<\/p><p style=\"\">After Ratonhnhaketon teaches his friend how to hunt they split up and try to collect food for the village, after a while he goes looking for his friend, Ratonhnhaketon sees him run past and then see a bear chasing him. After dodging the attack from the bear Ratonhnhaketon returns to the village and then is involved in a ritual where he is handed the Apple of Eden and is spoken to by <a href=\"\/juno\/3005-21083\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21083\">Juno<\/a> and told to go and find a man to help him train to be an assassin, <a href=\"\/achilles-davenport\/3005-24821\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24821\">Achilles Davenport<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5207\/2337450-screed3ascreenshots93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337450\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5207\/2337450-screed3ascreenshots93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2337450\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5207\/2337450-screed3ascreenshots93.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5207\/2337450-screed3ascreenshots93.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Achilles teaching Connor.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Achilles is an old member of the Assassin's and master swordsman. Reluctant to train Ratonhnhaketon at first, he ends up revealing what the assassin order really is and begins teaching him, after renaming him Connor for practical reasons (it's revealed at the end of the game that Connor was the name of Achilles's son who died at the age of seven). It's revealed to Connor that the Templar order has become organized in the region, lead by Haytham and his second in command Charles Lee.<\/p><p style=\"\">Connor begins killing the Templars, working his way up the ladder. He ends up teaming up with the rebels and becomes a key figure in the <a href=\"\/american-revolution\/3015-5163\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5163\">American Revolution<\/a> (for example, he dumps the tea into the bay during the Boston Tea Party).

Kenway begins to bond with Connor and it's revealed that it wasn't the Templars and Charles Lee who killed Connor's mother but George Washington who ordered the strike on Connor's village in an effort to keep the Natives from cooperating with the British. Connor thus severs ties with both George Washington and his father, concentrating solely on finding and killing Lee, despite a dying Achilles warning him that his father is not a non issue.<\/p><p style=\"\">Connor hatches an elaborate scheme to find and kill Lee by shelling New York. After making it inside of Lee's compound, Connor finds his father, who had warned Lee of Connor's arrival. Connor has no choice but to kill Kenway who admits that despite their differences, he's still proud of his son. Kenway did not have the key that Desmond was looking for, having given it to Lee. Connor eventually hunts down Lee several weeks later and after a chase that both brutally injures Lee and Connor, the assassin kills the Templar and gets the key.<\/p><p style=\"\">Connor is then visited by Juno who tells hime to hide the key somewhere where it couldn't be found. He hides it where Achilles is buried, allowing Desmond to find it. In the present, Desmond succeeds to unlocking the door and is faced with a sphere and Juno.

Minerva goes on to saying that the incoming solar flare will kill most but not all of mankind and that they'll be able to rebuild. Exasperated, Juno reveals that this will only lead to a new cycle for humanity, as Desmond will become a sort of Christ figure among men ultimately leading to religious oppression for all of mankind.<\/p><p style=\"\">Desmond decides to side with Juno, stating that the loss of life is too large to seriously consider Minerva's plan.

Our hero then awakens in a world where he has never joined the Assassins and instead remained with his tribe (Thus he was never given the name of Connor is only referred to as Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton). He remembers the events of his life with the Assassins but when he brings up events that occurred no one else seems to remember these events. What's more he is awakened by his mother (Kaniehti:io) who shouldn't be alive.<\/p><p style=\"\">Kaniehti:io tells him that George Washington has proclaimed himself king (which Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton refuses to believe) and claims that she had a chance to stop him but failed. She leads him to Lexington and Concord where Washington has attacked and encounter Washington who claims he is going to attack their village. Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton and Kaniehti:io race back to their village but not before meeting fellow tribes-people. They encourage Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton to drink the Tea of the Red Willow tree in order to gain the strength to defeat Washington. However, his mother forbids it explaining that while it does give the person who drinks it special abilities, it has severe downsides as well.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon returning to the village, Kaniehti:io argues with the village elder for her belief in the Tea, but the village elder remains steadfast in her belief that the tea is the only way to defeat Washington. Instead, Kaniehti:io gives Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton the hidden blade, but Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton already knows what it is which Kaniehti:io doesn't understand why that is. Just then Washington, along with his generals Israel Putnam and Benedict Arnold, attack the village. Kaniehti:io tries to stop him but Washington kills her with a specter made from the Apple of Eden. Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton then tries but can't damage him due to the Apple of Eden and then Washington damages him and shoots him several times with guns to make sure he is dead.<\/p><p style=\"\">However, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton wakes up five months later in a cave with the surviving members of his clan including the village elder. The village elder demands Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton climb the Red Willow tree and make the tea. He begrudgingly decides to do this because he wants to know why these events are happening. Drinking the tea, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton goes on a vision quest (the Animus effect to the player). After this vision quest he now has the ability to turn invisible for a certain period of time and summon wolves to attack enemies.<\/p><p style=\"\">He then rescues some more of his tribe but this proves to be a distraction as when he returns to the cave he finds his whole tribe dead including the village elder. With her dying wish, she wishes Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton to murder Washington, Putnam and Arnold. He tracks Putnam to Valley Forge, then trails him to Arnold's hideout. He then proceeds to kill Arnold. With his dying words, Arnold says he has no idea what he was doing and that he was under Washington's control. Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton says he knew what he was doing at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/assassins-creed-iii\/3030-37494\/#toc-0-34\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37494\">West Point<\/a>, but Arnold says he has never been to West Point.<\/p><p style=\"\">He then says that Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton should rescue the jailed Benjamin Franklin in Boston but before Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton can come to, Putnam hits him on the head with a pistol knocking him out. When Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton comes to, he is in the back of Putnam's carriage headed for Boston. However, Putnam claims that he will soon take Boston on his own and he will present Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton's head to Washington as a victory trophy.<\/p><h3>The Tyranny of King Washington: The Betrayal<\/h3><p style=\"\">The fourth pack will be part 2 of the King Washington story arc titled The Betrayal.

After repelling the attack, the player is tasked with finding the Chalice, a sacred item that is said to have the ability to unite all opposing factions under one flag thereby ending the Crusade. Told by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1134\" href=\"\/al-mualim\/3005-1134\">Al Mualim<\/a> that such power is too dangerous to be in the hands of men, Alta\u00efr is ordered to destroy it.<\/p><p style=\"\">Throughout the game <a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"\/altair\/3005-48\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> encounters the leader of the Templars assigned to finding the Chalice, Lord Basilisk. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"\/altair\/3005-48\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> receives aid from local Keepers of the Assassins Bureaus such as Rafik, and other allies he meets along the way. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2950\" href=\"\/assassins-creed\/3030-2950\">Assassin's Creed<\/a> veterans will visit familiar locations such as <a data-ref-id=\"3035-447\" href=\"\/acre\/3035-447\">Acre<\/a>, which is under siege by the Templars, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-446\" href=\"\/jerusalem\/3035-446\">Jerusalem<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-445\" href=\"\/damascus\/3035-445\">Damascus<\/a>, as well as new locations Alep, Tyre, and the Temple of Sand.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">When starting a new game you can select either \"Easy\" or \"Medium\" difficulty, with \"Hard\" unlocks after finishing the game once. Many of the gameplay elements closely resemble those of the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2950\" href=\"\/assassins-creed\/3030-2950\">Assassin\u2019s Creed<\/a>, albeit in a simplified or modified form. This game is more heavily involved with platforming, combat, and puzzle-solving than in stealth for the majority of the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">Combat is reminiscent of the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2950\" href=\"\/assassins-creed\/3030-2950\">Assassin\u2019s Creed<\/a> game. Typically, if you are surrounded, one guard will square off with you while the others surround you. Blocking is done with the \"R\" button which can then be followed up by a counter-attack if timed appropriately as an enemy attacks. Breaking the enemy\u2019s guard and dealing extra damage can be done by using powerful combo attacks that are learned as the player progresses through the game. For example, Y+Y+Y executes Quick Strikes; a fast and easy-to-use attack that ends in a spinning strike.<\/p><p style=\"\">The life bar does not regenerate over time as it is not a measurement of synchronization. Attacking civilians has no effect on it (or on them, for that matter). To regenerate health you must collect red orbs which can be found by either killing enemies, in containers such as jars, or on the ground.<\/p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3015-24\" href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\">Stealth<\/a> is present and is necessary during some parts of the game but is mostly optional. Using the \"R\" button while the sword is sheathed, <a href=\"..\/..\/altair\/94-48\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> can sneak past or behind guards and use the \"A\" button to grab and assassinate them using the hidden blade. If guards are alerted to your presence, the life bar flashes red until all guards that see you are killed or you are able to lose them by running away. Traditional hiding spots such as piles of hay, benches, or rooftop gardens are not available.<\/p><p style=\"\">Blending in with the crowd is possible very late in the game with disguises--which completely alter <a href=\"..\/..\/altair\/94-48\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alta\u00efr<\/a>\u2019s appearance--and by using scholars.<\/p><h4>Weapons<\/h4><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"\/altair\/3005-48\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> begins the game with the hidden blade and sword, and he acquires more weapons by progressing in the game. With the exception of the hidden bade, the touch screen is used to select a weapon that is used with the \"Y\"button.<\/p><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3055-962\" href=\"\/hidden-blade\/3055-962\"><b>Hidden Blade<\/b><\/a> \u2013 Not used in combat but rather as a tool to assassinate lazy or unaware guards and targets. To do this, sneak using the \"R\" button and press the \"A\" button when you\u2019re close to the target.<\/li><li><b>Sword<\/b> \u2013 The primary weapon used for direct fighting. The \"Y\" button swings a fast but weak attack while the \"X\" button swings a slower but heavier attack. The sword is upgradeable by using blue orbs.<\/li><li><b>Daggers<\/b> \u2013 Throw at an enemy to do light damage and stun for a limited time. You can use this chance to make an escape or as an opening for attack. You are limited to carrying 15 daggers at a time which can be re-supplied by weapon crates in some stages.<\/li><li><b>Explosive Bombs<\/b> \u2013 Bombs cause a small explosion in an area that kills enemies within its range and creates a distraction where the explosion is. They can be dropped with a timed fuse if used while standing still, or thrown straight ahead if used while running. Explosions are necessary at some points in the game to destroy obstacles. Alta\u00efr can carry 5 bombs at once which are re=supplied from bomb crates in some stages.<\/li><li><b>Crossbow<\/b> \u2013 Used to shoot \u201carrows\u201d (according to the game's description it doesn\u2019t use bolts) at enemies from afar. To target an enemy, their icon must be tapped on the touch screen map, and if they are in range they will highlight green. Getting a good, high vantage point is key in successfully utilizing this weapon as most enemies will die from one shot from the crossbow. You are limited to 15 arrows at a time.<\/li><li><b>Grappling Hook<\/b> \u2013 Latches onto certain beams indicated by a glowing green orb which can be used to swing to another location. Also used as a tool to pull guards from a medium range towards Alta\u00efr, stunning them and leaving them open for a stab kill.<\/li><li><b>Smoke Bombs<\/b> \u2013 These work similarly to explosive bombs except that they let off a disruptive cloud of gas instead of an explosion. Enemies are disoriented and start gagging on the gas giving you the perfect opportunity to escape. You are also limited to carrying 5 of these.<\/li><\/ul><h4>Upgrade System<\/h4><p style=\"\">Blue orbs are scattered throughout the game; sometimes in plain sight and sometimes in pots that can be broken with the \"A\" button. And still yet others can be acquired from defeating enemies. The upgrade menu (a blue orb) is in the upper-right corner of the touch screen accessed by tapping it.<\/p><p style=\"\">The sword has three levels which cost 100 orbs for the first upgrade. Upgrading increases your base damage.<\/p><p style=\"\">Health can also be upgraded with increasing cost increments per level. Doing this adds a bar to the life counter.<\/p><h4>Mini-Games<\/h4><p style=\"\"><a href=\"..\/..\/altair\/94-48\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> has to pick-pocket several targets throughout his travels usually to obtain a key to proceed to a new area. This is accomplished by using the stylus in the DS version to navigate an item through an oblivious targets' bag while avoiding the sides and other items that are jostling around inside as well. Bumping anything causes a meter to drop, and draining a meter empty results in failure. However, the player can simply try again immediately with no repercussions.<\/p><p style=\"\">In order to obtain information, rather than simply stalking a target and beating him up, <a href=\"..\/..\/altair\/94-48\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> grabs the target which triggers a mini-game that uses pressure points to force co-operation. This game is timing-based with circles on the screen that must be tapped at a certain time. There is also some dragging involved as <a href=\"..\/..\/altair\/94-48\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alta\u00efr<\/a> pulls the subject\u2019s arm.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are also many puzzles spread throughout the game that require the use of items such as boxes, levers, buttons, and so forth.

The game will play much like its sideview platform\/action predecessor on the DS Alta\u00efr's Chronicles.","description":"<h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game takes place between the events of the Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities (the extra content available for Assassin's Creed II) in the year 1491. Ezio Auditore da Firenze is to meet with another assassin, Antonio, the leader of the Thieves Guild in Venice. Upon finding Antonio, Ezio finds that there is a Spaniard that requires his help by the name of Luis Santagel whose accomplice, Christoffa Corombo, had conversed with Rodrigo Borgia who had shown interest in Christoffa's plans to sail West. Luis suspects a trap and requests Ezio's help to rescue his accomplice. It turns out Luis' suspicions were well founded, and Ezio discovered that it was indeed a trap but successfully rescued Christoffa. Through the events of the game, Ezio meets Helene Dufranc who was born into the assassins but is dismissive of their Order. After travelling to Spain to rescue several assassins who were being held by the Spanish Inquisition, Ezio finds out about the plans of the Templar to reach the New World.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">The gameplay takes a side-scrolling perspective, and all action is rendered on a 2D plane. Many of the elements from Assassin's Creed II made their way into the gameplay of Discovery, including ledge assassinations, counter-attacks and the awareness system which allows Ezio to spot guards before he is seen.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are three distinct mission types: Chase, Stealth and Normal missions. Chase missions are tests of your ability to speed through a level often with a timer or a person that has to be reached. The main point of the stealth missions is to stay out of sight through means of hay stacks, barrels, ledges as well as assassinating a portion of the guards.<\/p><p style=\"\">The guards have been sorted into different sets, and as such, have different defenses and abilities.

Approximately 40% of the game occurs across the sea, as the other 60% remains on land - with \"50 unique locations\" including fisherman villages, jungles, temples, plantations, forts, complete islands, and Mayan ruins. Each of the areas have different gameplay focuses. For example, the Mayan ruins are based around puzzle solving and platforming, while the Coconut Islands are inhabited by enemies to fight.<\/p><p style=\"\">The three largest cities, however, are Naussau (the pirate haven), Kingston (a lively, dangerous town), and Havana (the capital of Cuba).

Using the d-pad, players select Kenway's primary weapons (swords, hands, or hidden blades) and his secondary weapons (pistols, smoke bombs, rope darts, sleeping darts, or berzerk darts) for use in battle. The same parry-into-combo system from previous games returns, with a successful parry and kill leading into the ability to chain kills quickly.

Simply hitting the fire button from the side view will fire heavy shot, a flaming, short range attack that does massive damage. The back view will fire exploding barrels behind the player. Additionally, when acquired mortars can be fired at any time, with their button generating an aiming circle that can be moved side to side and forward and backward.<\/p><p style=\"\">Successful destruction of an enemy ship results in explosions and burning sails, but it also gives the player the ability to board the ship. Choosing to board puts the player in control of Kenway with escalating requirements for success based on the power of the ship.

To pay for the medical fees, SCUD then freelances as an assassin to pay for the bills. <br\/>\u00a0<br\/>The video game is based on the Rob Schrab comic of the same name.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":11835,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/0\/5056\/814320-scud___the_disposable_assassin_coverart.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5056\/814320-scud___the_disposable_assassin_coverart.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/0\/5056\/814320-scud___the_disposable_assassin_coverart.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5056\/814320-scud___the_disposable_assassin_coverart.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/0\/5056\/814320-scud___the_disposable_assassin_coverart.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/0\/5056\/814320-scud___the_disposable_assassin_coverart.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/0\/5056\/814320-scud___the_disposable_assassin_coverart.png"},"name":"Scud: The Disposable Assassin","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-1\/","id":1,"name":"ESRB: T"}],"original_release_date":"1997-12-31 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-42\/","id":42,"name":"Saturn","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/saturn\/3045-42\/","abbreviation":"SAT"}],"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/scud-the-disposable-assassin\/3030-11835\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-7004\/","date_added":"2008-04-01 15:40:19","date_last_updated":"2015-11-26 22:00:36","deck":"Agent 47 is forced out of retirement and takes up contracts again in order to find the whereabouts of his captured friend.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the second game in the <a href=\"\/hitman\/3025-306\" data-ref-id=\"3025-306\">Hitman franchise<\/a>, in which players take the role of <a href=\"\/agent-47\/3005-889\" data-ref-id=\"3005-889\">Agent 47<\/a> - a genetically engineered killing machine gone rogue. This game kicks off a while after the final showdown in <a href=\"\/hitman-codename-47\/3030-6709\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6709\">Hitman: Codename 47<\/a>, and Agent 47 has quit the <a href=\"\/assassin\/3015-1321\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1321\">assassin<\/a> trade to work as a gardener in a Sicilian church. However, it doesn't take long until troublemakers stir things up and kidnap Agent 47's priest and mentor, <a href=\"\/father-vittorio\/3005-2722\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2722\">Father Vittorio<\/a>, which forces Agent 47 to return to his past.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gameplay-wise, there are many refinements in this sequel to the original game. The first obvious change is the control scheme, which has been fine-tuned for the third-person shooter perspective.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"\/io-interactive\/3010-3562\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3562\"> IO Interactive <\/a>also added an optional first-person perspective and a visual meter in order to give the player a basic outlook on the enemies' suspicion level, a feature that was further enhanced in later releases of the Hitman franchise.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another major addition in Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the new rating system. In the first game, there weren't any real incentives to get players to take a stealthy approach during the missions, which basically went against the design philosophy. In Silent Assassin, players are rated after each mission according to how they've performed - the lesser kills and detections, the higher the rating. The challenge comes in approaching the main target without having any hoodlums seeing Agent 47 come in or out. Players who mastered this were given the honorable title \"Silent Assassin\", which locked up hidden weapons and tools. Players who just go on a mad gun-crazed frenzy are often branded as \"Mass Murderer\".<\/p><h2>Levels<\/h2><h3>Sicily<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Agent 47's mentor and friend, Father Vittorio, has been kidnapped by the Sicilian Mafia, and they demand 500,000 in ransom. Unfortunately, Agent 47 is all out of cash, so he'll have to take some other approach to free the Father.<\/p><h3>St. Petersburg<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In return for information as to Father Vittorio's whereabouts, 47 must complete a small assignment for his former employers. This small assignment quickly evolves into four assassinations and a rather hairy run-in with a Spetznaz agent.<\/p><h3>Japan<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Agent 47 goes to Japan to eliminate an arms dealer and to recover a missile guidance system from his castle.<\/p><h3>Malaysia<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This time, the Agency calls in 47 to eliminate a powerful hacker who has his hands on an important piece of missile defense software.<\/p><h3>Nuristan<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Agent 47 goes to the Middle East to retrieve some important piece of cargo for his Agency.<\/p><h3>India<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A mysterious Indian cult has gotten their hands on some nukes.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h4>Melee<\/h4><ul><li>Anaesthetic<\/li><li>Fiber Wire<\/li><li>Kitchen Knife<\/li><li>Combat Knife<\/li><li>Scalpel<\/li><li>Golf Club<\/li><li>Katana Sword<\/li><li>Fire Axe<\/li><\/ul><h4>Pistols<\/h4><ul><li>Silverballer .45<\/li><li>Silverballer .45 Suppressed<\/li><li>9mm Pistol<\/li><li>9mm Pistol Suppressed<\/li><li>Deagle<\/li><li>Stub-Nosed Revolver<\/li><li>.54 Pistol<\/li><li>.22 Suppressed<\/li><\/ul><h4>Sub-Machine Guns<\/h4><ul><li>Uzi<\/li><li>SMG<\/li><li>SMG-SD6<\/li><\/ul><h4>Assault Rifles<\/h4><ul><li>AK-74<\/li><li>M4<\/li><\/ul><h4>Shotguns<\/h4><ul><li>Double-Barreled Shotgun<\/li><li>Sawn-Off Shotgun<\/li><li>SP12 Shotgun<\/li><\/ul><h4>Sniper Rifles<\/h4><ul><li>Crossbow<\/li><li>R93 Sniper<\/li><li>Dragunov SVD Sniper<\/li><li>MI95 Sniper<\/li><li>W2000 Sniper<\/li><li>W2000 Custom Sniper Rifle<\/li><\/ul><h4>Heavy Weapons<\/h4><ul><li>M60 LMG<\/li><\/ul><h2>HD Re-release<\/h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin was re-released with high definition graphics as part of the <a href=\"\/hitman-hd-trilogy\/3030-40084\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40084\">Hitman: HD Trilogy<\/a> on January 29, 2013.

The Wii Remote is also used in a dueling mode where the player sword-fights enemies in first-person-perspective using the Wii Remote, matching on-screen prompts to block and attack. To remain hidden within shadows the player can blow out candles or extinguish lanterns with water. A cover system is provided that allows the player to cling to walls or look around corners to spot potential enemies and threats. As in many other stealth-based video games, the player has the option of picking up and moving the body of a deceased enemy to decrease the chance of detection by remaining enemies.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":24617,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/3\/34651\/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/34651\/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/3\/34651\/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/34651\/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/3\/34651\/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/3\/34651\/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/3\/34651\/1811078-tenchu4psp.jpg"},"name":"Tenchu: Shadow Assassins","number_of_user_reviews":2,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-27\/","id":27,"name":"CERO: C"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-2\/","id":2,"name":"PEGI: 16+"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-16\/","id":16,"name":"ESRB: M"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-12\/","id":12,"name":"OFLC: MA15+"}],"original_release_date":"2009-02-03 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-18\/","id":18,"name":"PlayStation Portable","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation-portable\/3045-18\/","abbreviation":"PSP"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-36\/","id":36,"name":"Wii","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/wii\/3045-36\/","abbreviation":"Wii"}],"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/tenchu-shadow-assassins\/3030-24617\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-16004\/","date_added":"2008-04-01 16:24:36","date_last_updated":"2015-05-10 07:12:24","deck":"Play the role of a highly skilled ninja assassin in this blood soaked stealth action game.

You play as one of two ninja: <a href=\"\/rikimaru\/3005-1590\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1590\">Rikimaru<\/a>, a scar-faced, white-haired ninja armed with a sword, and <a href=\"\/ayame\/3005-2757\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2757\">Ayame<\/a>, a female ninja who uses wakizashi as her weapons. The two play differently, with Rikimaru being stronger, but Ayame being faster and having more combos. Both are equipped with grappling hooks, which let the ninja climb up and down rooftops, adding some fluid movement and flow in action\/adventure games not seen at the time. All levels take place at night, due in part to graphical limitations of the PlayStation. The two ninjas also use other tools, including poison rice treats, smoke bombs, sleeping potions, explosives, and throwing stars to get past dogs and guards. There is a puzzle element to the game, as the objectives are vague enough to tell the player what to do, but don't really explain what steps need to be taken, unlike contemporary stealth game <a href=\"\/goldeneye-007\/3030-3166\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3166\">Goldeneye<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are ten missions total in the game, but it does offer replay value in if you beat levels without being detected: the ninjas get special items varying from a spell that makes you look like an enemy to sleeping potions.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p style=\"\">Rikimaru and Ayame are two members of the Azuma ninja clan and grew up and trained with each other. Their heroic master, <a href=\"\/lord-gohda\/3005-12555\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12555\">Lord Gohda<\/a>, employ the two as spies to root out corruption and gather information in his province.

Onikage and Rikimaru are rivals, having faced off several times, with Onikage being more of a demon and Rikimaru being more human. Mei-Oh is the final boss of the game, but Onikage persists in the series as the main antagonist.<\/p><p style=\"\">Towards the last mission, Gohda's daughter and Ayame's close friend <a href=\"\/princess-kiku\/3005-12539\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12539\">Princess Kiku<\/a> is kidnapped by Onikage, but rescued by the two ninjas.<\/p><h2>Expansions and Versions<\/h2><p style=\"\">Following critical success, the game was re-released in Japan in 1999 as Tenchu: Shinobi Gaisen with updates including the levels found in the American version, different mission layouts, and notably, a mission editor where players could create their own levels.<\/p><p style=\"\">100 of the levels created through this in-game mission editor were selected in a competition from the game's original developer and released in November 1999 as a standalone disc called Tenchu: Shinobi Hyakusen.

Through various dialogue choices, he recounts the events that led to his capture; events that players will play through themselves and serve as the game's primary tutorial. Geralt's recollection picks up a few months after the first game's ending, with him in bed with <a href=\"\/triss-merigold\/3005-14601\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14601\">Triss Merigold<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Since Geralt is still suffering from long term amnesia, the story explores more of his violent past through various quests and flashbacks.

Players can also <a href=\"..\/..\/character-import\/92-970\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">import a save game<\/a> and see how their previous decisions affected these characters and the world. As players make these decisions, Geralt's journal is updated with poetic text as if it was being written by a bard singing his praises.<\/p><p style=\"\">The first game's controversial card collection mini-game centered around <a href=\"\/romance\/3015-253\" data-ref-id=\"3015-253\">romance<\/a> has been dropped in favor of a more realistic depiction, instead showing fully animated cutscenes with any partner.

He is being interrogated by Vernon Roche, the commander of the Blue Stripes (Temeria's Special Forces). Geralt insists he did not kill the king and recounts the events that lead to his death.<\/p><p style=\"\">Geralt's begins his story with Foltest's assault against the La Valettes, a conflict which arose from Foltest's denial of bastard children he fathered with Lady La Valette and the desire of Temeria's noblemen to use his children as a 'banner' to usurp his kingdom. Up to the day of the assault, Geralt had followed Foltest in the campaign for he served as the King's supposed lucky charm, having saved him from a previous attempt on his life. Also accompanying them was the Witcher's lover, Triss Merigold, who served as Foltest's personal advisor and court sorceress.<\/p><p style=\"\">During the attack, the Witcher faces Aryan La Valette, the lady's eldest son, whilst a dragon flys across the keep, decimating both armies. The Witcher eventually delivers King Foltest to where his children are being held, guarded by a blind monk. Given the Witcher's appearance, Foltest asks him to stand aside, lest he frighten his already frazzled children. With Geralt distracted, the monk drops his hood and blindfold (revealing himself to be a heavily muscled Witcher), and cuts the king's throat from ear to ear. The Witcher pursues but the killer escapes out a nearby window and onto a Scoia'tael (Elven guerilla fighters) ship waiting below.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791540-witcher2__50_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791540\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791540-witcher2__50_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791540\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791540-witcher2__50_.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1791540-witcher2__50_.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Siege of La Valettes<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">When Geralt finishes his tale, Roche is intrigued, but skeptical. However, the two deduce that the Scoia'tael's involvement bears investigation. Ultimately, Roche decides to help with Geralt escape the prison. The Witcher escapes that very night, and together with his Triss, Roche and the rest of the Blue Stripes, sets sail for Flotsam, where an infamous elf named Iorveth and his Scoia'tael were known to operate.<\/p><p style=\"\">Upon arriving in the city's outskirts, they immediately encounter Iorveth who attacks and is later seen conversing with the assassin. Geralt, Triss and Roche flee to Flotsam, where Geralt discovers his friends Dandelion the bard and Zoltan Chivay the dwarf, who are about to be hanged. Roche and the Witcher saves them from their fate, thus making his presence known to Flotsam, and particularly its ruler, the so called Commandant Loredo.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Commandant informs the Witcher of the difficulties facing Flotsan, including attacks from the Scoia'tael and the Kayran, a beast that has halted traffic along the river. He tells Geralt that if he deals with the latter, he will have his full support in finding Iorveth. Geralt agrees, then kills the monster with the help of a sorceress named Silla, who came to the outpost to claim the contract for the creature.<\/p><p style=\"\">After defeating the beast, Geralt meets a Scoia'tael lieutenant on a prison barge docked outside town who claims the kingslayer, known as Letho, intends to betray Iorveth. As it turns out, Zoltan was to be hanged for conspiring with the Scoia'tael, because Commandant Loredo was notoriously discriminatory toward non-humans. Thus the dwarf arranges a meeting between Geralt and Iorveth, where the Witcher informs the elf of the kingslayer's intentions. The pair decide to confront Letho, who in turn reveals that he was planning to betray Iorveth. Before the two can capture Letho however, Roche arrives with an armed force. Geralt duels the Kingslayer and is subsequently defeated. However, Letho spares his life, revealing that Geralt once saved the lives of Letho and his own band of witchers. He then kidnaps Triss, forcing her to teleport them to Aedirn.<\/p><p style=\"\">At this point in the story, Geralt can either continue on with Roche or Iorveth.<\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Act 2 - Iorveth's Path<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\">Geralt and Iorveth steal the prison barge docked in Flotsam and set sail for Aedirn. Upon their arrival they stumble upon a meeting between King Henselt of Kaedwen and the rebel army of Prince Stennis (the son of the slain King Demavend), and his commander Saskia the Dragonslayer. A battle breaks out only to be interrupted by an ancient curse, activated when blood spatters on an ancient sculpture. Spectral soldiers, the souls of Henselt's soldiers who died in a horrid battle 3 years earlier, attack the group. Iorveth and Geralt, along with the sorceress Philippa Eilhart (now serving as advisor to Saskia), escort Saskia and Prince Stennis across the ghost field battlefield, returning them safely to Vergen. The rebels hold a meeting where Saskia announces her intentions to lead a rebel army against King Henselt. An army comrpised of Vergen's dwarven forces, Iorveth's Scoia'tel, and Stennis' soldiers. The group rallies behind Saskia, declaring her Queen, but as the meeting concludes she falls ill to a powerful and mysterious poison.<\/p><p style=\"\">Geralt decides to not only track down the ingredients for an antidote, but to gather a series of magical artifacts to lift the curse from the former battlefield.<\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Act 2 - Roche's Path<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\">Roche discovers Commandant Loredo is spying for the Kaeweni and asks Geralt to kill him. Geralt and the Blue Stripes then set sail for Aedirn. Upon their arrival they stumble upon a meeting between King Henselt of Kaedwen and the rebel army of Prince Stennis (the son of the slain King Demavend), and his commander Saskia the Dragonslayer. A battle breaks out only to be interrupted by an ancient curse, activated when blood spatters on an ancient sculpture. Spectral soldiers, the souls of Henselt's soldiers who died in a horrid battle 3 years earlier, attack the group. Geralt and Roche help the group fight off the spectres and with the aide of his two mage advisors, Dethmold and Sile de Tansarville, escort King Henselt across the battlefield. Once the group arrives safely in the Kaeweni camp, Henselt tasks Geralt with not only removing the curse from the battlefield, but one from the king himself. A curse placed on him by another sorceress by the name of Sabrina Glevissig, whom Henselt had burned to death following the battle 3 years earlier.<\/p><p style=\"\">In the meantime, while Geralt continues his search for Triss and the Kingslayer, he uncovers a plot accusing Henselt of conspiring with the Nilfgaardians. He soon discovers that Triss has been taken by Nilfgaardian spies, who have taken her to the ancient elven city of Loc Muine. After the curse is lifted, two witchers by the name of Auckes and Serrit, in league with Letho, attempt to kill King Henselt. Geralt defends the king, killing Auckes in the battle. Dethmold casts a spell allowing Geralt to look into the now deceased Aucke's memories, revealing that the Kingslayers are in league with Sile de Tansarville. Shortly thereafter, Geralt lifts the curse from the battlefield and Henselt marches on Vergen. It is revealed that Roche has been leading the insurgency and Henselt has all his men hung. Roche and Geralt make way for Vergen, hoping to track down Sile and Phillipa Eilhart, who they now know are behind Demevend's death. They miss the pair, who left for Loc Muine, with Saskia as their prisoner. They then confront Henselt, where Geralt kills the king's bodyguard. Geralt then chooses to either let Roche get his revenge by killing Henselt, sparking a civil war, or convince him to spare the king's life.<\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Act 3<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\">Depending on who Geralt assisted in Act 2, he arrives in Loc Muine with either Iorveth or Roche.  Mages from the various kingdoms have convened in the city to discuss the formation of a new magical organization called \"The Conclave.\"  As a result, many of the realms royal leaders are also in the city and Phillipa Eilhart and Sile de Tansarville plan to use the still spellbound Saskia as leverage.  At the same time, Geralt tracks down the Nilfgaardian spies who are holding Triss hostage.  If he arrived with Roche, he finds that Dethmold has kidnapped Princess Anais, Foltest's daughter.  He then must decide to rescue Triss or Anais.  If Geralt sided with Iorveth, he finds that Phillipa has been captured by King Radovid of Redania, who carves her eyes out.  Geralt must then choose to rescue Triss or Philippa, who is the only person who can free Saskia from her trance.<\/p><p style=\"\">If Geralt chooses to save Anais, Roche murders Dethmold out of revenge, and the two can choose to send her to either King Radovid or John Natalis of Temeria. If he rescues Philippa, the Nilfgaardians begin a witch hunt, implicating all the mages, but Saskia establishes a free kingdom in the Pontar Valley.  If the player saves Triss, the Nilfgaardian plot is destroyed with the death of Renauld.  The mages re-establish themselves, and Temeria is dissolved.  Dethmold manages to escape and Roche takes Anais into exile.  During the meeting, Letho arrives with the Nilfgaardian forces in tow and reveals the sorceress' plot.<\/p><p style=\"\">S\u00edle escapes and activates her teleportation device. However, Letho sabotaged the device and it kills her. Geralt can choose to let her die or save her life and allow her to escape. Geralt then battles Saskia in dragon form and ultimately defeats her. If he assisted Saskia and Iorveth and chose to rescue Philippa, he is able to break the spell over Saskia's mind, otherwise he must choose to kill her or let her live on in dragon form.  <\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><strong>Epilogue<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p style=\"\"><ins><\/ins>Geralt then finally confronts Letho, the kingslayer, who frees Triss if Geralt did not save her. Geralt can choose to talk to Letho or kill him outright.  If he chooses the former, Letho reveals that he is in fact a witcher from the school of the viper in the south, along with Serrit and Auckes. Geralt once saved them and turned over Yennefer of Vengerberg to their care. They eventually made their way into Nilfgaard, where the Emperor, Emhyr var Emreis,  asked them to destabilize the Northern Kingdoms by assassinating kings. In exchange, the Emperor promised to build a new witcher school for them.  After the confrontation, Geralt reunites with Triss and either Iorveth or Roche, and sets off to Nilfgaard to find Yennefer.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1759006-071_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759006\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.62533333333333\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1759006-071_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759006\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1759006-071_noscale.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1759006-071_noscale.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The four skill trees.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The combat from the first game has been overhauled and relies on four major skill trees. Each node on the skill tree has two levels, and some can be further upgraded with mutagens found in the game.<\/p><ul><li><b>Training -<\/b> Increases Geralt's general combat and physical capabilities like his stamina and ability to parry or block in combat. Players must invest a minimum of 6 points in this talent tree to unlock the remaining three.<\/li><li><b>Swordmanship -<\/b> Improves Geralt's sword fighting skills and gives him new moves and abilities. Affects both the normal and silver swords the witcher carries.<\/li><li><b>Magic<\/b> - Improves Geralt's knowledge of \"Signs\" (which are essentially magic spells he can cast in combat). There are multiple branches which improve the effectiveness of an existing sign by adding extra damage or special effects like a stun.<\/li><li><b>Alchemy<\/b> - Improves effectiveness of potions, oils and bombs made using alchemy. Some talents allow for use of multiple potions or reduce their side-effects.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">The multiple stance and rhythmic timing-based system has been dropped in favor of a more fluid, action-oriented approach, inspired by games like <a href=\"\/batman-arkham-asylum\/3030-23245\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\">Batman: Arkham Asylum<\/a> and powered by the <a href=\"\/havok-physics\/3015-502\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok physics engine<\/a>. Geralt now has two basic attacks: Quick (Left Mouse) and Strong (Right Mouse), that can be strung together to perform various <a href=\"\/combo\/3015-18\" data-ref-id=\"3015-18\">combos<\/a>. Players can <a href=\"\/block\/3015-1843\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1843\">block<\/a> incoming attacks and with the right timing, execute a <a href=\"\/parrying\/3015-2485\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2485\">parry<\/a> and <a href=\"\/riposte\/3015-4316\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4316\">riposte<\/a> or perform <a href=\"\/dodge\/3015-2476\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\">dodge rolls<\/a>. With good placement, players can trick enemies into causing <a href=\"\/friendly-fire\/3015-2243\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2243\">friendly fire<\/a> damage on each other. The engine features more gory &amp; brutal kill animations. A series of finishing move or execution style animations can be triggered when attacking a stunned opponent, these instantly kill the target.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4344\/1761681-witcher2_2011_04_17_00_09_08_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761681\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4344\/1761681-witcher2_2011_04_17_00_09_08_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761681\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4344\/1761681-witcher2_2011_04_17_00_09_08_12.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4344\/1761681-witcher2_2011_04_17_00_09_08_12.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Duels aren't always solved at swordpoint and sometimes involve Quick Time Events (QTES) if turned on in the options menu.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Spells, traps and potions can still be used during combat and remain a major component. Geralt can use barrier spells to ward off tougher enemies, telekineses to crowd control and cast offensive spells like fireballs to deal damage. Trap placement has been expanded up to three levels, with increasing benefits based on how many traps Geralt lays down. Players can also slow down time by bringing up a <a href=\"\/radial-menu\/3015-737\" data-ref-id=\"3015-737\">radial menu<\/a> (by holding down the CTRL key) and change weapons, items and spells on the fly. The game has an optional combat log window that details all the stat calculations going on behind the scenes. One thing players cannot do is drink health giving potions or otherwise heal mid-combat, meaning preparation for big encounters is vital to survival.<\/p><p style=\"\">With the addition of detailed environment, players can use lighting and shadows to <a href=\"..\/..\/stealth\/92-24\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">stealth<\/a> around enemies. The cat potion from the first game has been changed to give Geralt a pseudo-X-ray vision, very much like Batman's <a href=\"..\/..\/detective-mode\/92-6244\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">detective vision<\/a> in Arkham Asylum. Players can also engage in hand-to-hand duels that use <a href=\"..\/..\/quick-time-event\/92-6\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">quick-time events<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">There are multiple <a href=\"..\/..\/minigames\/92-116\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mini-games<\/a> involving fist-fighting, arm-wrestling, dueling, poetry, gambling etc. The number of delivery quests has been cut down in favor of more exploration and combat focused quests. There are also detective <a href=\"..\/..\/side-quests\/92-338\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">side-quests<\/a> where players have to use environmental hints to track down monsters and solve mysteries. Character customization has been expanded to a great degree and players can change almost every aspect of Geralt's weaponry and clothing. In addition, players can also craft their own weapons or upgrade existing ones, further building upon the importance of collecting ingredients and crafting materials from slain enemies, various containers, and vegetation.<\/p><h3>Alchemy<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4344\/1761666-witcher2_2011_04_16_13_28_09_44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761666\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4344\/1761666-witcher2_2011_04_16_13_28_09_44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1761666\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4344\/1761666-witcher2_2011_04_16_13_28_09_44.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4344\/1761666-witcher2_2011_04_16_13_28_09_44.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Slaying monsters gives a chance at rarer ingredients.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Alchemy no longer requires stringent environmental conditions like fire and can be used to create potions anywhere. In order to create potions the player must <a href=\"\/meditation\/3015-3910\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3910\">meditate<\/a>, but unlike the previous game brewing no longer takes up game time. Alchemy can be used to create three main items:<\/p><ul><li><b>Potions<\/b> - Liquid compounds that grant temporary powers. They are created by adding herbs and monster body parts to a chemical base, like alcohol. They are also the only alchemy product to have side effects associated with their use. This poisonous side effect is measured in terms of \"Toxicity\".<\/li><li><b>Oils -<\/b> Oils are special chemicals applied to swords and other weapons to increase their damage or effectiveness against certain types of enemies.<\/li><li><b>Bombs -<\/b> Powerful explosives that can be used to stun or outright kill an enemy from a distance. Depending on their type and quality, they can cover considerably large areas.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Geralt starts with the knowledge of some basic alchemy recipes but the rest are learned by shopping in towns, looting corpses or collected as quest rewards. There are 9 natural compounds used in alchemy: Aether, Caelum, Fulgur, Hydragenum, Quebrith, Rebis, Sol, Vermillion and Vitriol. These can be extracted from various sources, like herbs or animal parts.<\/p><h3>Mutagens<\/h3><p style=\"\">Being a Witcher, Geralt is a mutant warrior who can use mutagens to enhance his innate abilities even further. When used, these chemical reagents permanently increase the stats for one of his abilities. These can be looted from dead bodies or created as a by-product from alchemy. They are found in three varieties: Lesser, Basic and Greater; each increasing stats by an ascending amount.<\/p><p style=\"\">Mutagens can be used to gain one of the following effects:<\/p><ul><li><b>Critical Effect<\/b>: Increase Geralt's critical chance in melee combat.<\/li><li><b>Range<\/b>: Increase the range of Signs.<\/li><li><b>Power:<\/b> Increase sword or melee damage<\/li><li><b>Strength<\/b>: Increase damage reduction<\/li><li><b>Concentration<\/b>: Increase damage dealt by Signs.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Enhanced Edition<\/h2><p style=\"\">Released on April 17th 2012 as a free digital update for the PC, as well as a retail release - and included with the Xbox 360 version right from the start - the Enhanced Edition introduced over one hundred enhancements, tweaks, bug fixes and changes to the core game of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, plus hours of new content such as new quests, new locations and new cutscenes.<\/p><p style=\"\">A pre-loader for the PC version was released several days before the initial release of the Enhanced Edition to try to eliminate traffic on day-one since the update has over ten Gigabytes of new files. It was made clear that the directory should not be moved before the game was successfully updated on April 17th.<\/p><h2>Version 2.0<\/h2><p style=\"\">Released the 29th of September 2011, this free patch, brings two new game modes to the Witcher 2: Dark Mode, and an Arena mode; along with various tweaks and enhancements, and a tutorial. All of these will be shipped on-disc for the Xbox 360 release.<\/p><h3>Dark Mode<\/h3><p style=\"\">Dark mode is a new difficulty level designed for people wanting new challenge for their subsequent play-throughs, and it adds an assortment of powerful, new, dark themed items to the game.<\/p><h3>Arena Mode<\/h3><p style=\"\">An arena mode that allows the player to fight waves upon waves of enemies -- of which get progressively stronger and more difficult to defeat -- to achieve the highest score the player can. Leaderboards have been set up so players can strive to have the highest score of any Witcher 2 player. This mode also introduces a new enemy.<\/p><h2>Announcement<\/h2><h3>Promotional Video Leak<\/h3><p style=\"\">On Sept 16, 2009, a video was leaked from <a href=\"\/cd-projekt-red-sp-z-oo\/3010-2890\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2890\">CD Projekt<\/a>'s offices that was intended as promotion to obtain a publisher. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JciyoGmnGyo\" rel=\"nofollow\">In the video<\/a>, it is described that the team has worked hard on improving graphics from the original game, and completely revamping the way the world works.<\/p><h3>Announcement Trailer<\/h3><p style=\"\">In March 2010 an official trailer for the game was released showing that <a href=\"\/atari-inc\/3010-182\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari<\/a> would once again be publishing for the developer. The trailer depicted story elements of a large man who specifically targets Kings to assassinate, a man with black hair and an eye patch, and Geralt with a pony tail instead of the hairstyle used in the first game. It can be inferred that Geralt must fight the other two aforementioned men as major antagonists of the game.<\/p><p style=\"\">Thorough fans were able to find a single frame hidden in the trailer with a secret message to dedicated fans about the game from the developer. They promise that the fans will enjoy the sequel as they made it to be very similar to the original, but to creatively enhance and extend the properties of it. They also mention that they feel that claims of PC gaming and PC RPGs being dead are \"unagreeable\" due to the fact that the first Witcher sold 1.5 million copies on PC alone.<\/p><p style=\"\">The text of the hidden message (original smilies included) reads:<\/p><blockquote><p style=\"\">This message is for our biggest fans. Analyzing our stuff pixel by pixel. It's good to see you again! :-)<\/p><p style=\"\">BTW: Simple minded people think that nobody is reading these days, dear reader of this, we think that we can agree that is bullshit, huh?<\/p><p style=\"\">Same as the fact that single player RPGs are dead, or PCs?<\/p><p style=\"\">We sold 1.5 million units of the game from a dying genre on a dying platform - so we somehow cannot agree ;-)<\/p><p style=\"\">Before we start talking about TW2 please let us thank you for your great support and appreciation.<\/p><p style=\"\">It always motivates us and make us happy.<\/p><p style=\"\">We started working on TW2 right after release of TW. Our goal was to create all the things which made TW so great even better in TW2.<\/p><p style=\"\">We are very proud of TW but lets be honest, it was our debut. We never made any game before, and we practically learned as we worked.<\/p><p style=\"\">So there were many things which could be done better, you know it as good as us :-)<\/p><p style=\"\">But the vision, the main concept, remains the same: a game with a mature, captivating and non linear story, and full of spectacular combat.<\/p><p style=\"\">A game created by a team of independant thinkers immune to corporate priorities, who don't care what's trendy at the given moment.<\/p><p style=\"\">The core vision of the game hasn't changed. What has changed is the quality and the maturity we can deliver. That's largely because we're more experienced and also due to the fact that we've created our own technology. Do you remember how we made significant improvements with the Aurora Engine in the original game, but it still had its limitations?<\/p><p style=\"\">Now we've created technology designed specifically to create non-linear games with extensive plotlines and a living word...<\/p><p style=\"\">Well, there's no point in expanding on that too much - you have to check out our tech yourselves!<\/p><p style=\"\">Nevertheless, we have many reasons to believe that you will like The Witcher 2!<\/p><p style=\"\">See you soon and stay tuned! :)<\/p><\/blockquote><h3>Xbox360<\/h3><p style=\"\">On 06.02.2011 during a pre E3 conference in Venice Beach CD Projekt team announced the release of an Xbox 360 version by the end of the year.
