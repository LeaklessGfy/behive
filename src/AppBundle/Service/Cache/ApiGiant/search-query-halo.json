It begins in year 2531, twenty years prior to the events of <a href=\"\/halo-combat-evolved\/3030-2600\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved<\/a>, and documents the Covenant eradication of the Outer Colonies during the <a href=\"\/human-covenant-war\/3015-2708\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2708\">Human-Covenant War<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p style=\"\">The game was developed by <a href=\"\/ensemble-studios\/3010-1360\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1360\">Ensemble Studios<\/a>, best known for their work on the <a href=\"\/age-of-empires\/3025-22\" data-ref-id=\"3025-22\">Age of Empires series<\/a>, and is an Xbox 360 exclusive. During the development, Ensemble Studios stayed in contact with <a href=\"\/bungie-studios\/3010-476\" data-ref-id=\"3010-476\">Bungie<\/a>, creators of the Halo <a href=\"\/halo\/3025-2\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">series<\/a>, to ensure the game retained the proper look and feel. Some of the specific graphical touches in the game, like getting a scoreboard at the end of each game, the menu system, basic <a href=\"\/custom-ui\/3015-2554\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2554\">UI<\/a> and the style of multiplayer lobbies are evocative of other games in the series. Ensemble Studios also took extra care of the game's controls to ensure that the often-complex actions of an RTS are easy to deal with on the Xbox 360 controller.<\/p><p style=\"\">Shortly after the release of the game, the news broke that Microsoft Studios was shutting down Ensemble Studios.<\/p><p style=\"\">Two downloadable content packs were released for the game by Robot Studios, which handled post release support of the game, until March 2010 when the newly formed <a href=\"\/343-industries\/3010-6753\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6753\">343 Industries<\/a> took over all support.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19745\/870134-6876.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870134\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19745\/870134-6876.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870134\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/19745\/870134-6876.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Bring incredible firepower to bear on your enemies<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The game's story is told through in-game cut scenes, and in-game moments like games in the series. Halo Wars is set in 2531, giving it the earliest setting of the Halo game series, and focuses on the Marine forces of the <a href=\"\/unsc\/3015-3859\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">UNSC<\/a> ship CFV-88 <a href=\"\/the-spirit-of-fire\/3055-1918\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1918\">Spirit of Fire<\/a> as they engage Covenant ground forces after the discovery of an ancient artifact during a journey to <a href=\"\/harvest\/3035-338\" data-ref-id=\"3035-338\">Harvest.<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\">The story begins with the UNSC's early battles on Harvest, but also features another colony world, <a href=\"\/arcadia\/3035-2452\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2452\">Arcadia<\/a>, which holds something of great interest to the Covenant. The <a href=\"\/the-flood\/3015-645\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">Flood<\/a> is significant in the storyline and several massive <a href=\"\/the-forerunner\/3015-80\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunner<\/a> structures are also explored.<\/p><p style=\"\">Although <a href=\"\/master-chief\/3005-175\" data-ref-id=\"3005-175\">the Master Chief<\/a> doesn't make any appearance in Halo Wars, several other <a href=\"\/spartan\/3015-666\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">SPARTAN<\/a>s do, these are referred to as Red Team. Other key characters in Halo Wars include the A.I. <a href=\"\/serina\/3005-8610\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8610\">Serina<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ellen-anders\/3005-9815\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9815\">Professor Ellen Anders<\/a>, <a href=\"\/john-forge\/3005-9816\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9816\">Sergeant John Forge<\/a> and the Spirit of Fire's commander, <a href=\"\/captain-james-gregory-cutter\/3005-9817\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9817\">Captain Cutter<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Story<\/h3><p style=\"\">While Sergeant forge is patrolling the northern regions, Alpha Base is attacked and destroyed by the Covenant, with survivors fleeing to the countryside surrounding the area. Rounding up the survivors, Forge leads them in an assault to remove the covenant presence and re-establish Alpha Base. Forge then leads an attack on a relic site that the Covenant has occupied, eventually removing any remaining Covenant, and making it possible for Anders to examine the relic briefly. The Covenant makes a counter-attack, forcing the UNSC to retreat. However, the information Anders gathered from the relic shows that the Covenant has been pointed to a second UNSC colony, <a href=\"\/arcadia\/3035-2452\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2452\">Arcadia<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/319\/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214121\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56275303643725\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/319\/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214121\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/319\/214121-halo_wars_handson.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption> All Units!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Following the Covenant to Arcadia, they find that most of the orbital defence ships have been destroyed or damaged in battle with the Covenant. Forge and his forces are deployed to assist the Spartans from Red Team, in an effort to evacuate the civilians from Arcadia City. After they've evacuated, they withdraw to a safer position while waiting for back-up by Spartan Group Omega. Once the back-up arrives, they move in to find out why the Covenant came to Arcadia. Forge and Anders begin to study the area, but suddenly <a href=\"\/ripa-moramee\/3005-11521\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11521\">the Arbiter<\/a> arrives, taking Anders prisoner and wounding Forge; Spartans arrive, but too late to save Anders.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Arbiter uses Anders to activate the Apex (a Forerunner installation), revealing a fleet of Forerunner warships, which the Covenant plans to incorporate into their existing fleet. However, Anders manages to escape by using her stasis prison as a translocation device. She then links up with Forge and his Marines, who've managed to clear the area of Covenant forces and establish a base of operation on the Shield World. The UNSC removes the FTL Reactor from the Spirit of Fire and moves into the Apex, planning to detonate it - in hope of the chain-reaction will destroy the whole Forerunner installation and fleet. The Arbiter attempts to stop them, but his Honor Guards are killed by Red Team, and Forge himself manages to kill the Arbiter with one of his own <a href=\"\/energy-sword\/3055-115\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">Energy Swords<\/a>. Forge stays behind to detonate the reactor, <a href=\"\/heroic-sacrifice\/3015-3530\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3530\">sacrificing himself<\/a>, while the rest of the UNSC forces activate a portal, to get them out of the blast radius, and evacuates to the Spirit of Fire.<\/p><p style=\"\">Since they had to rip out the FTL Reactor, the Spirit of Fire has lost its ability to go faster than light, making the journey home much, much longer than the crew could survive on their limited supplies. The crew therefore enter cryogenic storage. Here, Sergeant John Forge's cryo-tube is closed by Captain Cutter, who briefly nods, while the camera pans down on the words \"Sgt. J. Forge\", acknowledging the sacrifice he made.<\/p><p style=\"\">Serina speaks the final words of the game, in the last moment of the credits over the game's logo, saying:<\/p><blockquote data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"center\"><p style=\"\">Captain. Wake up. Something has happened.<\/p><\/blockquote><p style=\"\">The ultimate fate of Spirit of Fire is unknown, and unfortunately will continue to remain unknown, as the game's lukewarm sales and the closing of Ensemble Studios make the possibility of a sequel to Halo Wars slim to nil.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Technology Advancement<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3484\/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205968\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3484\/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205968\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3484\/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3484\/205968-935835_20080715_screen007.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Covenant base struck from orbit by Spirit's MAC cannon.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Throughout the campaign and while playing skirmishes, the player must advance their technology in order to bring out heavier fire power.

Field Armories or Temples, and their upgrades, can become available when technology is increased.<\/p><p style=\"\">How to advance in technology is different from both factions.

This is explained through the new Mark VI suit, which injects bio-foam directly into the wearer's wounds. <a href=\"\/stealth-camouflage\/3055-846\" data-ref-id=\"3055-846\">Active Camo<\/a> has been removed as an item. Instead, the Arbiter has a rechargeable version of Camo, instead of a <a href=\"\/flashlight\/3055-156\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlight<\/a> like the Chief.

The game had many advanced features including <a href=\"\/matchmaking\/3015-3334\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3334\">matchmaking<\/a>, <a href=\"\/voice-chat\/3015-648\" data-ref-id=\"3015-648\">voice chat<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/leaderboard\/3015-30\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">rankings<\/a>. There was also some customization implemented into the game as well, which created a lot of <a href=\"\/user-generated-content\/3015-129\" data-ref-id=\"3015-129\">user created content<\/a>. Many games came out of these customization options, such as Tremors, Troy, Vehicle Wars and the most popular being <a href=\"\/zombie\/3015-79\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">Zombies<\/a> which grew so popular Bungie saw fit to put it into Halo 3. Players really enjoyed the customization options and kept many players sticking around even after getting their fill of matchmaking. The match making games were very competitive in Halo 2 due to the intensive ranking system. The way the ranking system in Halo 2 works is when the player first starts playing the game they start at level 1 and as they win matches their level increases. If they lose enough matches they can drop levels. These ranking were taken very seriously by the Halo 2 community. The color of the level a player had was very important to most Halo 2 fanatics. They can see what the levels look like in the picture below.<\/p><p style=\"\">Levels 44-50 were \"secret\" levels -- they were picture of various things, such as the moon or the halo ring.<\/p><p style=\"\">Halo 2 had 24 maps the people could play online and was the most played game ever on Xbox Live. Even after the Xbox 360 was released Halo 2 still remained the most popular. The first game to top the amount of online players Halo 2 had each month, was the original <a href=\"\/gears-of-war\/3030-12231\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Cla<b>n<\/b><\/h3><p style=\"\">Halo 2 is one of the few Xbox games ever that supported \"clans\", which are basically a group or team of players that play games against other \"clans\". This was a huge part of Halo 2 and was very successful. Clans on console games have never really worked that well and Halo 2 introduced a quick, and easy, way to make them without having the dedication PC clan members have. To check out their clan the player can press the Y button and bring up the friends list, they can scroll right, which will bring them to the clan page. If they are not in a clan, they can join a clan (if they were invited to a clan). They must receive a \"clan invite\" to be able to join a clan. If they have not been invited to a clan, they can create their own clan. If they decide to go down this route, they will be asked to create a unique name for their clan. This name can not be changed and must be appropriate, or Bungie will reject the name. After creating a name, they must invite people to join the clan. Players are only allowed to be in one clan at one time. When members join, they will first be at the level of member, but the Overlords of the clan are allowed to change their status.<\/p><h3>Clan Status Levels<\/h3><ol><li><u>Overlord<\/u>- The creator of the clan is the Overlord and has complete control over the clan. The Overlord can elect other trustworthy clan members to also be an Overlord.<\/li><li><u>Staff<\/u>- Staff members are important respected members of a clan. Their level of power can vary by the amount of power the Overlord gives Staff members.<\/li><li><u>Membe<\/u>r- When someone joins a clan, they are a Member. This is the middle class in a clan. Most clan members are Members. Members do not hold much power.<\/li><li><u>Peon<\/u>- The level of Peon is the lowest level of status.

The map compilation was developed primarily for Xbox owners that are not subscribed to Xbox Live. The disc also includes a bonus three-minute Halo 2 cutscene (showing what happens to the marines in the Pelican that is shot down in the intro sequence to the level Outskirts), a video documentary on the development of the maps included in the disc, the original trailer for Halo: Combat Evolved, the Halo 2 announcement trailer, and a humorous audio clip used to test the surround sound set-up. The disc is also backwards-compatible with the Xbox 360 and is the only current way to download the Bonus, Killtacular, and Maptacular map packs. (Unless the Windows Vista version is being played.)<\/p><h2>Multiplayer Glitches<\/h2><p style=\"\">Several weeks and months after Halo 2's release, players began to discover and take advantage of several relatively major glitches in the game. As players began to practice these glitches and become well-versed in executing them they gained a much more significant place in the <a href=\"\/meta-game\/3015-905\" data-ref-id=\"3015-905\">meta-game<\/a>, with some of the weapon-based glitches becoming essential for success against the higher ranking players. While game creator Bungie officially decreed on several occasions that a player's use of glitches for personal gain, in a Matchmaking setting, was a form of cheating, the developer had no way of tracking the use of such glitches by players. Ultimately, there were no widespread punishments or repercussions handed-down to players who utilized these glitches.<\/p><p style=\"\">Some of the most noteworthy glitches:<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/bxr\/3015-2751\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2751\"><b>BXR<\/b><\/a><\/h3><p style=\"\">Commonly used in conjunction with the <a href=\"\/br55-battle-rifle\/3055-132\" data-ref-id=\"3055-132\">Battle Rifle<\/a> (though possible to execute with any reloadable weapon) the BXR was a weapon animation glitch that allowed for a nearly instantaneous close-ranged kill. The glitch became very widespread among the highest ranks of players as the meta-game progressed.<\/p><h3>Quick Reload (YY)<\/h3><p style=\"\">Another glitch commonly used among higher-caliber players, the Quick Reload glitch was a weapon animation glitch that shaved precious seconds off of a player's reload time, allowing them to fire their weapon again sooner than they normally would with the default reload. The glitch was only possible when a player was carrying a secondary weapon. The move was executed by the player pressing the Y button twice in quick succession as soon as the reload animation reached the point where the in-game character began to insert a new clip into the weapon. If done properly the player will quickly switch to their secondary weapon and then back to their primary, eliminating the rest of the reload animation while still giving the player a full clip.<\/p><h3>Double Melee (BXB)<\/h3><p style=\"\">A third weapon animation glitch, the BXB was used to give players a significant advantage in close-range combat. Executed by pressing B, X, B in quick succession (under the default controller settings), the glitch allowed players to melee twice in a much shorter time span than if they were simply to press the melee button two times. Contrary to the BXR, which required a full clip of ammo to execute properly, the BXB required the player to have a partially depleted or empty ammo clip in their primary weapon. As with the other weapon glitches, the BXB saw very widespread use among the top-tier players.<\/p><h3>Double Shot (RRX)<\/h3><p style=\"\">One of the most popular glitches among <a href=\"\/major-league-gaming\/3015-1858\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1858\">MLG<\/a> fans and players, the Double Shot was a glitch that was used primarily with the Battle Rifle that allowed players to fire two of the weapon's 3-shot bursts in one shot, resulting in 6 bullets being fired at once. The downside to this glitch was that after successfully firing a Double Shot, there was a significant span of time (roughly two to three seconds) where the player could not fire their weapon, and could only attack if they threw a grenade, used a melee attack, or switched to a secondary weapon. For this reason players would often hold off on using a Double Shot unless they were one or several \"shots down\" in a BR fight, or had a secondary weapon that they could \"YY\" with to cancel the long delay after a successful double shot.<\/p><h3>Quad Shot (RRXYYRRX)<\/h3><p style=\"\">Similar to the double shot the quad shot, if done right, can shoot 4 shots out of the BR in half the time it normally would take. To do this the player need two weapons, first they start out with their double shot then they press \"YY\" really fast in order to cancel the reload; if they double shot correctly they will notice the reload animation isn't playing but it is still reloading in the background (this is normal so don't worry), now after pressing \"YY\" do another double shot, and with much practice the player can do <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lCEZz1zS3aQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">this<\/a>.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/super-bouncing\/3015-401\" data-ref-id=\"3015-401\">Super Bouncing<\/a> (also known as Super Jumping)<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5758\/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.7421875\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5758\/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908232\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5758\/908232-superbounce1.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5758\/908232-superbounce1.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A first-person view from a player who \"super-bounced\" to the top of the map Ascension.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">A glitch in the game's <a href=\"\/havok-physics\/3015-502\" data-ref-id=\"3015-502\">Havok<\/a> physics engine that makes it possible for players to \"bounce\" to extreme heights, enabling them to reach previously inaccessible and out-of-bounds regions on a multiplayer map. The glitch was used quite frequently in a Matchmaking setting to give a player or team a significant advantage through an unreachable hiding spot or unfair vantage point.<\/p><h3>Sword Canceling (Butterflying)<\/h3><p style=\"\">Sword canceling is a glitch that takes advantage of the \"lunge\" effect that the Energy Sword provides for the player. By aiming at an opponent with the Energy Sword at a close enough proximity for the reticule to light up red, then pressing the Right Trigger and X in quick succession, a player can achieve the normal Sword lunge without in any way damaging their opponent. The glitch is most commonly used to give players a means of reaching previously inaccessible ledges or areas of a map. The glitch earned the nickname \"Butterflying\" due to the strange, butterfly-like motion of the character model's arms when performing the sword cancel.<\/p><h3>Rocket Sword Glitch<\/h3><p style=\"\">A glitch that would require a sword and a rocket launcher as a secondary. The player would look at an enemy from a distance and rapidly alternate pressing \"Y\" and \"B\" and they would launch towards the person they were aiming at from afar.<\/p><h2>Cheating<\/h2><p style=\"\">As with most online games, Halo 2's online environment featured some players who manipulated and modified certain aspects of the game to provide themselves with an unfair advantage over their opponents. Players cheated most commonly in matchmaking playlists, so that they could more easily obtain a matchmaking rank that players would see associated with their gamertag. The highest-level matchmaking ranks, that featured symbols in place of numbers (ranks 44-50), were the most desirable and most sought after ranks to cheaters; therefore, non-cheaters often found it very difficult to play a legitimate, cheat-free match at the highest ranks. There were several different methods of cheating, each with different effects on gameplay.<\/p><h3>Modding<\/h3><p style=\"\">Achieved through the use of cheat-devices such as Action Replay, Modding was the most common, game-changing form of cheating. \"Modders\" manipulated map files and gametypes to create gameplay that was well-outside the normal limits placed by the game engine. Common modded elements were changes in player speed and gravity, changed weapon properties (such as <a href=\"\/plasma-rifle\/3055-122\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\">Plasma Rifles<\/a> that fired <a href=\"\/wraith\/3055-531\" data-ref-id=\"3055-531\">Wraith<\/a> projectiles), and changed vehicle properties (flying <a href=\"\/m12-warthog\/3055-193\" data-ref-id=\"3055-193\">Warthogs<\/a>, flying turrets, faster <a href=\"\/scorpion\/3055-760\" data-ref-id=\"3055-760\">Scorpions<\/a>, etc.). Due to the dramatic, game-changing effects of modding, it was fairly easy for Bungie's automated banning tool -- notoriously dubbed the \"Banhammer\" by players and Bungie staff -- to detect and ban players who used modded files in matchmade games. Most \"modders\" had only a few hours, at most, to rise through the matchmaking ranks before being faced with a permanent ban, and a vast majority of modders were inevitably banned. The problem was that there were so many free two-month Xbox Live trials available, it was easy for a modder to quickly make another account.<\/p><h3>Standbying<\/h3><p style=\"\">The second most game-changing form of cheating, behind Modding, was known as Standbying. Making use of the game's host-based server system, standbying was achieved by having the \"host\" player manipulate their internet connection to cause problems for the other players in the match. When the host managed to successfully tamper with their connection, it would cause all of the other players in the game to experience enormous amounts of lag. The host's Xbox was immune to the lag issues, and could travel around the map killing enemy players or completing game objectives without much, if any, opposition. Though the Standby glitch was originally achieved by players manually pressing the \"Standby\" button on their router, modem, or switch, eventually players used various computer software so that they could throttle the connections of only the opposing team, giving all of their teammates a reprieve from the negative effects of the glitch. Eventually, Bungie improved the banhammer to better detect and control \"standbyers\" in matchmaking.<\/p><h3>Bridging<\/h3><p style=\"\">Bridging was a method of controlling \"host\" in a matchmaking game, and, more specifically, a way of ensuring that a certain player in the game always received host. Unlike modding and standbying, though, bridging was not a very detrimental form of cheating on its own. Bridging was accomplished through the use of specific Firewall software that controlled the ports and incoming IP Addresses for a player's router or switch. By using the program with the correct settings, a player could be ensured of being host for every game they played. Also, due to the nature of the glitch, bridgers could not be matched with or against other bridgers, so the bridging player always decided who received host. While Bridging was used in conjunction with Standbying or Modding to ensure that those forms of cheating worked as efficiently as possible by giving a certain player host, it was also used as a preventative measure against cheaters. Some players used bridging to make sure that no nefarious players could obtain host, therefore ensuring a quality match experience. As of the 1.6 update for Halo 2, the most common methods of Bridging were no longer effective or possible in matchmaking.<\/p><h2><b>Soundtrack<\/b><\/h2><p style=\"\">The Halo 2 Original Soundtrack was released in two volumes, composed by <a href=\"\/martin-odonnell\/3040-1741\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1741\">Martin O'Donnel<\/a> and <a href=\"\/michael-salvatori\/3040-1742\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1742\">Michael Salvatori<\/a>.

The official makes various arguments as to the Spartan-II program having been unethical, including the facts that the program involved the kidnapping of children, that the Spartan-IIs were originally developed to stop human rebellion, and that the Spartan-IIs have shown sociopathic tendencies. Halsey justifies the program by stating that her work saved humanity from the <a href=\"\/the-covenant\/3015-81\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">Covenant<\/a> and works out that she is being interviewed because the UNSC are trying to replace the Master Chief. The scene ends with Halsey telling the official not to underestimate the Spartans and not to underestimate the Master Chief specifically.<\/p><h3>Forward Unto Dawn<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game then snaps to the wreckage of the derelict starship <a href=\"\/unsc-forward-unto-dawn\/3055-2812\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2812\">UNSC <i>Forward Unto Dawn<\/i><\/a>, in the year 2557 (four years after the events of Halo 3), as it drifts closer to an artificial <a href=\"\/the-forerunner\/3015-80\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunner<\/a> planet. Detecting a strange disturbance aboard the ship, Cortana wakes the Chief from cryo-sleep. They then make their way through the ship, finding Covenant are boarding and attacking them, despite a truce being declared four years ago with the <a href=\"\/covenant-elite\/3015-470\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites<\/a>, and experience the ship being scanned by unknown technology. The two soon discover that they are not just in proximity of one Covenant ship, but a whole fleet. The Chief is able to use the weaponry of the <i>Forward Unto Dawn<\/i> to destroy the Covenant cruiser closest to them, however a gravity well opens on the world which begins to pull the ship in.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana make their way towards the escape pods, although as they do Cortana starts exhibiting bizarre behaviour. As they reach the escape pods, the force of the gravity well begins tearing the <i>Dawn<\/i> apart and pulls the Chief out into space. After being knocked unconscious by flying wreckage he awakens inside the planet, where Cortana begins acting mentally unhinged. Despite her immediate response that there is nothing wrong with her, the Chief persuades her to tell him that she is in the first stages of a process known as rampancy, in which AI become increasingly mentally unstable and eventually cease functioning altogether. She explains that the average operational lifespan of a UNSC AI is seven years, and that she is now in her eighth year of operation. Although she tells the Chief that she cannot be fixed, he insists that they will find a way back to her creator, Dr. Halsey, so that she may be repaired.<\/p><h3>Requiem<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief fights his way through more of the Covenant forces, which are composed of the \u201cStorm Covenant\u201d, a hostile splinter group of the religious faction. Cortana also detects a transmission from the starship <a href=\"\/unsc-infinity\/3055-5701\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5701\">UNSC <i>Infinity<\/i><\/a>, which the two attempt to reach the source of. Making it deeper into the planet, they manage to access a computer in an attempt to track the signal, and discover they are inside a Forerunner shield world called <a href=\"\/requiem\/3035-2921\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2921\">Requiem<\/a>. The system quickly locks up, but the two are able to bring it back online and Cortana is able to use it to find that the <i>Infinity<\/i>'s signal appears to be coming from the shield world\u2019s core. They then travel to a point on the other side of the facility to open a portal from which to reach <i>Infinity.<\/i><\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once they reach the destination from which the portal can be opened, Cortana notes that attempting to contact the point in the planet\u2019s systems closest to the core caused them to return the Forerunner glyph for Reclaimers (i.e. Humanity), which the Chief assumes has to indicate that the <i>Infinity<\/i> must be there. A number of unusual robotic beings then spring up around the two and a portal to the planet\u2019s core seems to spontaneously open. The Chief grabs Cortana\u2019s data chip and runs into the portal.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After the two arrive in Requiem\u2019s core, Cortana informs the Chief that the machines they saw were some kind of advanced defence AI, and they discover that while the <i>Infinity<\/i> is not stationed in the core of the planet, a satellite relaying the signal from <i>Infinity<\/i> is. However, Cortana also notes that there are two pylons on the planet interfering with the signal which they must disable if they are to contact the <i>Infinity.<\/i> While working to bring down the pylons Cortana works out that the metallic enemies they are now facing are called \u201cPrometheans\u201d and displays further signs of rampancy. She later discovers that <i>Infinity<\/i> isn\u2019t inside the planet, but that it is orbiting it, and appears to be responding to the distress beacon from <i>Forward Unto Dawn<\/i>. Cortana begins repeated attempts to contact the <i>Infinity<\/i>, trying to ward it away from the planet, so it is not sucked into the gravity well as the <i>Dawn<\/i> was.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After shutting down the first pylon, the two discover that the Covenant are heading to the second pylon, but the Chief manages to fight through further waves of both the Prometheans and Covenant, and successfully shut down the pylon. Despite the lack of interference, Cortana finds that the transmitter in the Master Chief\u2019s armour is not strong enough to transmit the necessary signal to the <i>Infinity,<\/i> and so they use the planet\u2019s portal system to reach the satellite in the core, from which they may be able to broadcast a more powerful signal.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After fighting their way to what they believe to be a broadcast system, and attempting to use it to contact they <i>Infinity,<\/i> they realize too late that they have been deliberately mislead; this is not a communications system, but a prison system, and their actions have accidentally released a Forerunner criminal known as the <a href=\"\/the-didact\/3005-24550\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24550\">Didact<\/a>. They discover that he had manipulated <i>Infinity<\/i>\u2019s signals as a trap to get them to release him, and declares that the Forerunner are returning and that he intends to destroy Humanity, whom the rest of his race had declared their successors, the Reclaimers. He easily knocks the Chief unconscious before taking a ship and escaping in it through a slipspace portal. The Chief wakes up with Cortana telling him that the Didact\u2019s use of slipspace destabilized the core of the planet, and that they must leave it immediately. At this point the <i>Infinity<\/i> also starts broadcasting an emergency signal indicating that they have been pulled in by Requiem\u2019s gravity well.<\/p><h3>The <i>Infinity<\/i><\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief escapes the core in a <a href=\"\/ghost\/3055-371\" data-ref-id=\"3055-371\">Ghost<\/a> which he eventually manages to jump through a portal. After arriving on the other side of the portal, he sees the <i>Infinity<\/i> flying overhead and hears a broadcast from it as the ship prepares to crash land. Cortana and the Chief set a course for the <i>Infinity<\/i>, seeing the Didact\u2019s ship also going in pursuit of it.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief finds the Didact\u2019s ship near <i>Infinity<\/i>\u2019s crash site and manages to make brief radio contact with the Infinity before making his way towards the ship. Inside the ship he meets with <a href=\"\/thomas-lasky\/3005-24200\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24200\">Commander Thomas Lasky<\/a> and Spartan-IV, <a href=\"\/commander-palmer\/3005-24205\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24205\">Commander Sarah Palmer<\/a>. He discovers that the recon team the <i>Infinity<\/i> sent out after they landed have become stranded, and won\u2019t be able to return to the ship on foot. At this point Lasky asks the Chief to secure the area so that the recon teams may be safely recovered, which he obliges.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As the Chief and Cortana attempt to help recovery of the recon teams, Cortana becomes worried by the increasingly intense signs of rampancy she is showing, despite the Chief\u2019s reassurance. As the Chief successfully secures a landing zone for Pelican-class ships to bring back the stranded soldiers, Lasky sends out a transmission indicating that the Covenant have managed to get into the <i>Infinity<\/i> and that all soldiers are immediately ordered to return to the ship. The Chief manages to make his way back to <i>Infinity<\/i> where he meets with <a href=\"\/andrew-del-rio\/3005-24206\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24206\">Captain Andrew Del Rio<\/a> who tells him that the Didact has managed to disable the ship\u2019s defences and is extracting data from it is mainframes. The Chief manages to use a Mantis-class mech to fight off the Covenant in the ship, and destroy the jammers that were preventing the ships defences from functioning.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">With defences back online the <i>Infinity<\/i> is able to use its MAC cannons to fire on the Didact\u2019s ship, causing it to retreat. At this point Del Rio orders the ship\u2019s forces to stand down, and the Chief, Cortana, Lasky, and Del Rio come together to assess the situation. Lasky explains that the purpose of the <i>Infinity<\/i> was to establish bases to study the <a href=\"\/halo\/3035-58\" data-ref-id=\"3035-58\">Halo<\/a> installations for decommission. After excavating a Forerunner artefact part of the <i>Infinity<\/i> science team were killed, but a series of co-ordinates were recovered that led the <i>Infinity<\/i> to Requiem. Despite the Chief\u2019s view that it would be an opportune time to attack the Didact while he is vulnerable, Del Rio instead makes it the mission of the <i>Infinity<\/i> to escape Requiem\u2019s gravity well and file a threat assessment with the UNSC Fleet Command.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Del Rio mobilises the <i>Infinity<\/i>\u2019s forces, including Chief, Cortana, Palmer, and Lasky, along with a number of vehicles, including a Mammoth-class troop transport, to take down particle cannons within the planet so that they can make their escape. Cortana again displays signs of further rampancy and expresses her worry over the situation, but she and the Chief eventually reach the particle cannon command post where an elevator takes them directly to the co-ordinates provided to them by the <i>Infinity<\/i>, leading them to think that they are walking into a trap.<\/p><h3>The Librarian<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Within the facility the two encounter \u201cwhat remains\u201d of a long-dead Forerunner known as the <a href=\"\/the-librarian\/3005-24643\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24643\">Librarian<\/a>. She explains that her memories had been stored within the facility to help Humanity adopt the Forerunner philosophy of \"the Mantle\", but that the Didact threatens that plan and must not be allowed to leave Requiem. She then informs the Chief that the Didact seeks a weapon known as the Composer which can contain the Forerunner\u2019s greatest enemy, humanity.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Librarian details a war fought between humanity and the Forerunners long ago, after humanity were seen doing what they believed to be aggressively expanding their control over the universe. Humanity overcame entire star systems before the Didact rose up and used his warriors to push them back. After a millennium of slaying humanity, the Didact was sentenced to punishment and the Forerunners discovered too late that humanity were not trying to expand, but were rather running from the Flood. Weakened after the war, the Forerunners started to fall easily to the Flood.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Forerunners made plans to use the Halo rings, the Ark, and the shield worlds to save all life in the galaxy, however, the Didact refused to yield to the philosophy of the Mantle and devised his own plan. The Composer was intended to be a tool to make the Forerunners immortal by allowing life to be converted from an organic to a digital form, which would have protected them from the <a href=\"\/the-flood\/3015-645\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">Flood<\/a>, as the Flood only consume and can survive by consuming organic tissue. However, the Composer could not convert sentient minds properly, and when the Forerunners attempted to return lifeforms to their organic state, it created only what the Librarian describes as \u201cabominations\u201d. The Didact used the Composer to take his revenge on humanity, with the Prometheans being the result of human beings being converted to a digital form. The Didact had intended to convert all of humanity, however, the Composer was forcibly taken from him and he was imprisoned.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When humanity was preserved so that they could repopulate the galaxy after the Forerunners had eradicated the Flood, the Librarian hid the \u201cseeds\u201d of humanity from the Didact. She had done this in part of a plan for the future of humanity, however, before the Librarian can inform the Chief of what this plan is, they are discovered by the Didact. Before the Chief leaves, the Librarian is able to biologically modify him to be impervious to the effects of the Composer.<\/p><h3>Del Rio<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Regrouping with <i>Infinity<\/i>\u2019s forces, he and the ship manage to destroy the gravity well. Del Rio, the Chief, Cortana, and Lasky, then meet once again on-deck. After explaining what the Librarian had told him the Chief tells Del Rio that it is imperative to humanity\u2019s safety that the Didact is stopped, however, Del Rio insists that their mission is still to leave Requiem, dismissing the story of the Librarian as a hallucination. After an outburst of rampancy from Cortana Del Rio orders Lasky to confiscate the data chip containing Cortana so that she may be decommissioned (read: executed). The Chief takes the data chip before he can do so, and refuses orders to surrender it to Del Rio, leading him to call Palmer to arrest the Chief. However, she does not comply, and the Chief then leaves with Cortana, instructing Lasky to send word back to Earth.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As Chief prepares his weapons Cortana stares at the Sun outside and laments her inability to actually know if it looks and feels real, eventually turning and telling the Chief to promise that, before their current conflict ends, he will figure out \u201cWhich one of us is the machine\u201d. Lasky arrives on deck with orders to prevent the Chief from leaving, but instead provides him a combat-ready Pelican with which to pursue the Didact.<\/p><h3>Post-<i>Infinity<\/i><\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana find the Didact\u2019s ship with its shields up and Cortana devises a plan to take them down by exploiting two nearby stations which are acting as traffic control for resources flowing to and from the ship. The Chief makes his way inside both of the stations to use them to send an override code into the ship, forcing it\u2019s defences down. The Didact becomes aware of their plan and manages to speak to the Chief directly, despite Cortana being unable to hear him, and uses Promethean and Covenant forces to try and keep them from achieving their objective.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After they successfully drop the ship\u2019s shields, Cortana directs Chief to another tower from which the ship is controlling a number of defence spires, with the plan being that if the Chief turns them against the Didact\u2019s ship, he can be prevented from leaving. The Cortana and Chief make their way to the control room at the top of the tower where Cortana attempts to use the defence spires to lock the Didact\u2019s ship in place, but her rampancy causes her to malfunction and lose control of the spires. With the Didact and his accompanying Covenant about to leave, the Chief takes Cortana and jumps from the tower onto a Covenant Lich-class vessel which he is able to ride on, as it, the other Covenant vessels, and the much larger Forerunner vessel which the Didact\u2019s ship now occupies, leave Requiem via slipspace.<\/p><h3>Ivanoff Station<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The ships emerge near Halo ring Installation 03 where they attack the nearby UNSC scientific facility that is in possession of the Composer, Ivanoff Station. The Chief enters the Covenant ship he is riding on, managing to kill its occupants, and makes contact with a Sandy Tilson on the station, however, their communication is cut short, and the ship crashes when Cortana once again malfunctions due to rampancy. The Chief wakes up on-board a damaged section of the station with Cortana emotionally unstable and apologising.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief communicates with Tilson again, who explains that they are trying to evacuate the station, but that Covenant have taken control of the landing bay. The Chief is able to secure an evacuation route for the scientists, bring the station\u2019s shields back online, and clear the station of Covenant. Upon reaching Tilson the Chief declares that the Composer needs to be removed from the station, however, Tilson explains that they literally cannot move it. Despite the initial objections of Tilson, he decides that if the Composer cannot be moved then it can be prevented from falling into the Didact\u2019s hands by annihilating it with nuclear weaponry.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana manage to make it to the station\u2019s defence grid controls to bring its defences back online, while the science team prime the nuclear bomb to destroy the Composer. Cortana, who is becoming increasingly rampant, asks the Chief that if she and he should make it back to Dr. Halsey, for him not to tell her how unstable she got, to which the Chief agrees. Before the Chief can meet back up with the science team, the Didact discovers the exact location of the Composer, and the Chief requests that the science team provide him with the nuke, despite it not being ready yet. The Chief manages to fend off Covenant making their way into the area housing the Composer, using a Mantis mech, but before it can be destroyed, the Didact manages to lift the Composer out of the station and into his ship.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief returns to the scientists as the Didact\u2019s ship takes aim on the station. Cortana finds that the station defences will not respond and the Didact manages to use the Composer to kill everyone within the station, apart from Cortana, and the Chief, who is knocked unconscious. When he awakens Cortana appears emotionally disturbed as she explains that she heard the digitized scientists being agonizingly converted into Prometheans. She then begins to speculate about how if she dies the UNSC will try to pair the Chief with another AI, possibly another version of Cortana, and tells the Chief \u201cIt won\u2019t be me, you know that, right?\u201d. The Chief tells Cortana that he won\u2019t let her die and assures her that \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet\u201d, but it is clear Cortana no longer believes this.<\/p><h3>The Didact's Ship<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief and Cortana arm a Broadsword-class fighter with the nuke and fly it off-station, into the Didact\u2019s ship as it flies into slipspace again. As the Chief fights his way across the Didact\u2019s ship in the Broadsword, he stays in contact with UNSC forces, most notably Lasky, aboard the <i>Infinity<\/i>, who has taken the position of Captain after UNSC Fleet Command objected to Del Rio abandoning a legendary war hero like the Master Chief on Requiem. The Didact\u2019s ship heads towards Earth, and the UNSC's orbital defences prove ineffective in stopping it.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief is eventually able to disable the particle cannons on the ship, allowing the <i>Infinity<\/i> to punch a hole in the hull which he can fly the Broadsword into. Once inside the ship\u2019s hull, free of the Broadsword, and carrying the nuclear device with him, the Chief inserts Cortana into the ship\u2019s systems, where she is able to manipulate a portal system, similar to the one on Requiem, so that the Chief may reach the Didact. However, when the Didact begins fighting back against Cortana she has difficulties simultaneously fighting him and keeping control over her rampancy.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief is eventually able to reach the room where the Didact and the Composer are housed. Here Cortana begins injecting the mentally instable and continually dividing versions of herself into the Didact\u2019s system, in an effort to bring down his shields as he powers up the Composer. The Chief makes his way around the chamber, manually inserting Cortana into the systems, using her rampancy to sabotage the Didact. Despite the Chief lowering his shields, the Didact is able to fire the Composer on Earth, hitting part of what is currently known as North America.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief reaches the core of the chamber where he crosses a light bridge to arm the nuke and destroy the Composer, but becomes cautious as the Didact no longer appears to be with the Composer, but hidden elsewhere. The Didact appears behind the Chief, encouraging him to fight him, but as he tries to do so the Didact is able to knock the nuke free from him and telepathically paralyse him. However, the rampant copies of Cortana in the ship\u2019s systems manipulate the light bridge to restrain the Didact, and the Chief manages to plant a grenade into his chest, the detonation of which causes the Didact to stumble and fall from the light bridge into the Composer\u2019s beam. The Chief then crawls towards the nuke and detonates it manually.<\/p><h3>The Ending<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Chief finds himself without Cortana in a blue translucent sphere in space that appears to have properties similar to a hologram or light-bridge. A physical manifestation of Cortana appears to him, but upon asking on how they can get out of this space, Cortana tells him that she can\u2019t go with him. She explains that most of her was on the Didact\u2019s ship and that she only saved enough of herself outside of that to protect the Chief and take him off the ship. The Chief insists that the two of them leave together, but Cortana informs him that it is impossible. For the first time Cortana physically touches the Chief, something she says she has been waiting a very long time to do, and he implies that he feels as though he failed in his duty to protect her. Cortana tells him that they were meant to take care of each other, and did so successfully. Cortana walks away from the Chief, despite him asking her to wait, and tells him \u201cWelcome home, John\u201d before disappearing entirely. Shortly after, the sphere around the Chief disappears and he begins floating off into space.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A Pelican eventually recovers the Chief who returns to the UNSC <i>Infinity<\/i>. On-deck in the ship he stares out at the Earth and is joined by Lasky who empathises with him over his loss. The Chief tells Lasky that as soldiers it is their duty to protect humanity, whatever the cost, to which Lasky responds that humanity and soldiers are not different things, and that soldiers are people, not machines. Lasky leaves the deck as the Chief remembers Cortana\u2019s earlier suggestion that he may be more like a machine than a person. The game then cuts to a closing message from 343 Industries, declaring that this is the start of a new journey with Halo, and that they thank their fans for joining them and trusting them with the Halo universe.<\/p><h3>Epilogue<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game\u2019s epilogue features UNSC soldiers exploring the city of New Phoenix, where the Composer\u2019s beam hit and left cities standing, but people entirely eradicated. Played over this is a speech by the Didact, apparently made millions of years ago, when he was defending himself against the crimes that got him locked up on Requiem in the first place. He speaks of the Forerunner defeat and how important they are to the universe. The game then cuts to the Chief, who is walking along a long corridor in the <i>Infinity<\/i>, as the Didact declares that he has been accused of the sin of 'preventing the Forerunners taking a less prominent role in the universe as other forces become more powerful.' As the game cuts to a scene of John having his armor removed, the Didact claims that Humanity is the greatest threat to the universe, that they must be stopped by the Forerunners, and that they have unfairly begun the process of 'Reclamation'. The last shot of the game is the Master Chief\u2019s helmet being removed, wiping to black. The Legendary ending replaces the wipe with a brief glimpse of John's eyes; his full face is not seen.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Weapons<\/h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Halo 4 includes a variety of new weaponry for players, including human weapons used by the UNSC (including the <a href=\"\/m363-remote-projectile-detonator\/3055-5702\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5702\">M363 Sticky Detonator<\/a>, Carbine-920 Railgun, and M739 SAW), and Forerunner weapons used by the Promethean A.I.

This is the first time in the franchise where competitive multiplayer is part of in-universe lore. Up to 16 players, with their customized <a href=\"\/spartan\/3015-666\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">SPARTAN-IV<\/a> soldier, can participate in free-for-all or team matches (with up to 8 teams) under a variation of customizable gametypes. Unlike every game in the Halo franchise (with competitive multiplayer) since <a href=\"\/halo-2\/3030-7110\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2<\/a>, players can no longer play as <a href=\"\/covenant-elite\/3015-470\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites<\/a> in any way.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The War Games mode includes ten new maps (one of which is a remake of <a href=\"\/halo-3\/3030-9993\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\">Halo 3's<\/a> Valhalla, which is a loose remake of <a href=\"\/halo-combat-evolved\/3030-2600\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved's<\/a> <a href=\"\/blood-gulch\/3035-322\" data-ref-id=\"3035-322\">Blood Gulch<\/a> and <a href=\"\/halo-2\/3030-7110\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2's<\/a> <a href=\"\/coagulation\/3035-1232\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1232\">Coagulation<\/a>), a variety of downloadable maps, and a variety of new game modes, including Dominion (a team objective-based mode in which teams gain points by maintaining control of special \"bases\"), Extraction (a team objective-based mode in which teams gain points by successfully capturing \"extraction sites\"), and Regicide (a deathmatch-based mode where the leading player, either in general or for each team, is designated the \"king\", who slowly gains special abilities while granting \"bounty points\" to players who kill him\/her). Slayer, Oddball, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill each make a return from previous Halo games. Infection mode has been replaced by Flood, which makes more use out of player loadouts and replaces <a href=\"\/zombie\/3015-79\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">zombie<\/a> Spartans with the <a href=\"\/the-flood\/3015-645\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">Flood<\/a>.

In game modes with Personal Ordnance (such as Infinity Slayer), players can earn their own specialized Ordnance Drop (in which they can choose between three choices of weapons, grenades, and power-ups) at their designated location after reaching a certain score threshold.

These new additions to the Forge toolset allow Forgers in Halo 4 to make maps with more creative geometry and aesthetically appealing designs than was possible in Reach:<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Dynamic Lighting:<\/b> In Reach, the Forge pieces that players could use to build their maps cast no shadows on the canvas map (typically Forge World) or on other pieces, and did not accept real-time shadows from the global light source of the map. This fact, along with the uniform gray color scheme of the Forge pieces, led to most Forge maps looking very similarly bland, which was a major source of complaint amongst the community. In order to help address this problem of poor aesthetics, the Halo 4 Forge mode features a new \"dynamic lighting\" system which allows the Forge pieces to accept real-time shadows from the global light source, and to cast shadows of their own, allowing for more variability in map design.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Player-Trait Zones:<\/b> In Halo 4's Forge, map makers have the ability to designate special areas of the map and give players within those areas unique traits or abilities with the addition of \"Player-Trait Zones\" to the Forge sandbox. Player-Trait Zones can be manipulated in the Forge space the same way that soft-kill zones or objectives zones (Hill markers, etc.) were in Reach. Forgers can use Player-Trait Zones to create a portion of the map where all players are invisible, for example, or create a zone with lowered gravity and increased jump height.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Object-Magnetism:<\/b> While building a map in Reach, objects could be moved precisely by using a zoomed-in camera or even by changing their exact coordinates, but it was still cumbersome for a player to perfectly align separate pieces. The Halo 4 Forge mode has a \"magnet\" feature that streamlines the process of aligning Forge pieces. Players can magnetize specific objects, which allows them to snap to other objects automatically for easier map building.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Highlighting<\/b>: Objects are illuminated in green when the player's reticle is hovering over them. This feature was added to make it less frustrating for Forgers to select the correct piece when modifying a map, because in Reach a player could not easily tell which piece they were selecting when there were many objects in close-proximity.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Duplication<\/b>: Forge Objects can be easily duplicated simply by highlighting the object and then selecting the \"duplicate\" option from the Forge menu.<\/p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><b>Locking:<\/b> Objects can be locked in place, preventing them from being moved until the player chooses to unlock them. This feature was added to help players preserve their work-in-progress designs and keep pieces from being accidentally moved.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><h3>Halo 4 Original Soundtrack (<a href=\"\/neil-davidge\/3040-101659\" data-ref-id=\"3040-101659\">Neil Davidge<\/a>)<\/h3><table><tbody><tr><th>No.<\/th><th>Track Title<\/th><th>Length<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1.<\/td><td><b>Awakening<\/b><\/td><td>5:41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2.<\/td><td><b>Belly of the Beast<\/b><\/td><td>2:38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3.<\/td><td><b>Requiem<\/b><\/td><td>2:16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4.<\/td><td><b>Legacy<\/b><\/td><td>2:29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>5.<\/td><td><b>Faithless<\/b><\/td><td>5:02<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6.<\/td><td><b>Haven<\/b><\/td><td>5:45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>7.<\/td><td><b>Nemesis<\/b><\/td><td>3:31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>8.<\/td><td><b>Ascendancy<\/b><\/td><td>4:20<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>9.<\/td><td><b>Solace<\/b><\/td><td>4:45<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10.<\/td><td><b>To Galaxy<\/b><\/td><td>4:57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>11.<\/td><td><b>Immaterial<\/b><\/td><td>7:33<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12.<\/td><td><b>117<\/b> (composed by Kazuma Jinnouchi)<\/td><td>7:28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>13.<\/td><td><b>Arrival<\/b><\/td><td>5:37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>14.<\/td><td><b>Revival<\/b><\/td><td>7:19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15.<\/td><td><b>Green and Blue<\/b><\/td><td>8:01<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>Halo 4 Original Soundtrack - Special Digital Edition<\/h3><table><tbody><tr><th>No.<\/th><th>Track Title<\/th><th>Length<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>16.<\/td><td>Awakening (Gui Boratto remix)<\/td><td>1:34<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>17.<\/td><td>To Galaxy (Sander Van Doorn &amp;

Players can now use separate buttons (defaulting to the \"bumper\" buttons) to reload each <a href=\"\/dual-wielding\/3015-135\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual-wielded<\/a> weapon (in which the secondary reload button doubles as switching grenades, if the player is not dual-wielding). Players can also carry and deploy (using the button originally used to reload) special portable \"equipment\" (including <a href=\"\/trip-mine\/3055-541\" data-ref-id=\"3055-541\">trip mines<\/a>, <a href=\"\/gravity-lift\/3055-1068\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1068\">gravitational lifts<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/bubble-shield\/3055-1066\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1066\">bubble shield generators<\/a>). Players can also now detach stationary turrets for portable use (albeit slower movement speeds and forced third-person perspective). The game also includes new vehicles, including the UNSC's mobile transport <a href=\"\/mongoose\/3055-803\" data-ref-id=\"3055-803\">Mongoose<\/a> and the Brute's attack motorbike <a href=\"\/brute-chopper\/3055-801\" data-ref-id=\"3055-801\">Chopper<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">The game also includes various improvements to Halo 2's multiplayer aspect. Players can now customize the armor permutations (including helmet, shoulders, and torso) for both their Spartan and Elite soldiers (each of which must be earned by completing goals and achievements throughout the game). Players can now be easily identified by their allies in-game through a custom Service Tag (composed of a letter followed by two numbers). Halo 3 includes a more robust matchmaking system with the TrueSkill ranking system, a new experience system (with a special ranking system in which players can earn different \"grades\" depending on their TrueSkill rank and experience points), special playlists (including playlists that grant double experience points), and the option to veto the first given map\/gametype combination. The game now includes a special Theater Mode (where players can watch game replays and crop them into smaller film clips or take screenshots) and <a href=\"\/forge\/3015-1929\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1929\">Forge Mode<\/a> (a unique <a href=\"\/in-game-map-editor\/3015-269\" data-ref-id=\"3015-269\">in-game map editor<\/a> where players can alter the placement of any weapon, spawn, item, or structure on any map) While the clan system from Halo 2 was removed, Halo 3 includes a new File Share system, in which players can upload custom gametype variants, film clips, screenshots, and \"Forged\" map variants into Bungie's servers, so that they can be downloaded by other players.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48227\/1104610-halo_3_odst_20090130094723553_640w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104610\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1149732620321\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.5%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48227\/1104610-halo_3_odst_20090130094723553_640w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104610\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/4\/48227\/1104610-halo_3_odst_20090130094723553_640w.jpg\"><\/a><\/figure><p style=\"\">Bungie later created a standalone campaign, running on a heavily modified Halo 3 engine, titled <a href=\"\/halo-3-odst\/3030-24035\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST<\/a>. Players play as an <a href=\"\/odst\/3015-641\" data-ref-id=\"3015-641\">Orbital Drop Shock Trooper<\/a> known as <a href=\"\/the-rookie\/3005-11077\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11077\">The Rookie<\/a>, who must investigate the whereabouts of his squad in the dark, dead city of <a href=\"\/new-mombasa\/3035-12\" data-ref-id=\"3035-12\">New Mombasa<\/a> (shortly after the events of Halo 2). Along with several new gameplay mechanics (including the VISR night-vision visor, silenced weapons, an open-world hub level, a new \"stamina\" system, and the introduction of the co-operative wave-based survival mode known as <a href=\"\/firefight\/3015-5869\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5869\">Firefight<\/a>), the game also includes a bonus disc containing the entire multiplayer component of Halo 3 (featuring all downloadable maps, including three time-exclusive maps known as the Mythic II Map Pack). Players who completed all seven Vidmaster achievements (from both games) received a special piece of multiplayer armor: the Recon Armor (formerly given by Bungie to exceptional community players, given to all players regardless of achievement progress after March 29, 2012).<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Mechanics<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5978\/483947-carzy1337.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483947\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"185\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 185px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5978\/483947-carzy1337.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483947\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5978\/483947-carzy1337.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5978\/483947-carzy1337.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>One of tens of thousands of multiplayer armour permutations.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The gameplay in Halo 3 has undergone some significant changes compared to its predecessors, including simple tweaks to make it more cohesive.

Bungie has assigned these special abilities to the \"X\" button, which was previously used to reload. Players now use the RB (right bumper) to reload the main weapon and LB for the secondary weapon if they are dual-wielding, although they can decide to use one of several other pre-made control schemes.<\/p><h3>The Load-Out<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/28248\/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874123\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9336734693878\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:193.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/28248\/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874123\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/28248\/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/28248\/874123-04reconchestshot.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A player brandishing the Recon Armor, formerly given to exceptional community members.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Bungie has added a different version of the original <a href=\"\/ag36-assault-rifle\/3055-616\" data-ref-id=\"3055-616\">Assault Rifle<\/a> (it has about half the clip size of the version in Halo: Combat Evolved, but it deals a little more damage and has better accuracy), strengthened the <a href=\"\/needler\/3055-135\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\">Needler<\/a> (though it can no longer be dual-wielded), and also included some new weapons like the <a href=\"\/brute-spike-rifle\/3055-139\" data-ref-id=\"3055-139\">Spikers<\/a> (Brute sub-machine guns) and the <a href=\"\/gravity-hammer\/3055-128\" data-ref-id=\"3055-128\">Gravity Hammer<\/a> (the Brute counterpart of the Elite <a href=\"\/energy-sword\/3055-115\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\">Energy Sword<\/a>). There are also 2 new grenade classes: The <a href=\"\/brute-spike-grenade\/3055-849\" data-ref-id=\"3055-849\">Spike Grenade<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/incendiary-cannon\/3055-1302\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1302\">Incendiary Grenade<\/a> (AKA the firebomb grenade). The former is a Brute-made grenade that sticks to objects before sending razor-sharp spikes flying in the direction of the blast, and the latter a UNSC weapon especially useful against the zombie-like Flood. Bungie also reduced the load-out on each grenade from the previous four, to two, allowing players to carry a total of eight grenades and switch between the types with the left bumper (when not dual-wielding). A player may also pick up turrets and flamethrowers, but by using them he\/she will switch into a 3rd person view, in which movement will be slightly restricted and ammo will become limited. There are also a few new vehicles like the <a href=\"\/mongoose\/3055-803\" data-ref-id=\"3055-803\">Mongoose<\/a>, a quadbike with two seats, the <a href=\"\/hornet\/3055-534\" data-ref-id=\"3055-534\">Hornet<\/a>, which is the human equivalent to the <a href=\"\/banshee\/3055-374\" data-ref-id=\"3055-374\">Banshee<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/brute-chopper\/3055-801\" data-ref-id=\"3055-801\">Chopper<\/a>, which resembles the <a href=\"\/ghost\/3055-371\" data-ref-id=\"3055-371\">Ghost<\/a> in that it has only one seat and can fire front-mounted cannons. One final new vehicle, the <a href=\"\/m312-elephant-hrv\/3055-1230\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1230\">Elephant<\/a>, is an enormous, invincible mobile base armed with two turrets. The Elephant appears only in the multiplayer level 'Sand Trap', and serves as each team's flag base in Capture the Flag mode, allowing players to actually move their flag around the level, albeit at a painfully slow pace.<\/p><h3>Multiplayer<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7439\/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-843770\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7439\/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-843770\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7439\/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7439\/843770-halo3_mythic_packthumb800x800_3131039171_27d38dab76_o.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Multiplayer gameplay on the Mythic map, \"Assembly\"<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Halo 3's campaign can be played co-operatively, locally, through System Link, and online on Xbox Live with up to four players, although only two players may play on a single Xbox 360. Unlike previous games, which just doubled the primary character, each player in Halo 3 is given a unique character; player one controls the Master Chief, player two controls the Arbiter (with small changes to the dialogue and cutscenes to reflect the fact that the Arbiter never leaves the Chief) and players three and four controlling unique Elites, who never speak and do not show up in cutscenes, though Bungie has named them <a href=\"\/ntho-sraom\/3005-6622\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6622\">N'tho 'Sraom<\/a> and <a href=\"\/usze-taham\/3005-6621\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6621\">Usze 'Taham<\/a>, respectively. In addition, Halo 3 can also be played competitively through a matchmaking service or in custom, user-created games. In matchmaking, players are matched with up to fifteen other players based on their rank and skill level in the individual \"playlists\", which are categorized into two groups depending on their overall purpose. Ranked playlists are used to match players based on their Trueskill rating. Social playlists allow players to play with others with no ranking system involved for each playlist, although Experience and overall skill still determines player match-ups. Few of the original achievements work in social matches, but the <a href=\"\/downloadable-content\/3015-329\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC<\/a> achievements all are unlockable in social playlists. One can also still earn Experience for the playlists, as well as global and playlist-specific Experience points (EXP). Finally, every weekend, Double Experience Weekend begins that focus on a very specific playstyle or gametype, including Grifball and Infection. The playlists are:<\/p><h4>Ranked<\/h4><ul><li><b>Lone Wolves - <\/b>Matches include 6 players and use free-for-all game modes, like Slayer, Swords, Slayer BRs, Crazy King, and Oddball.<\/li><li><b>Team Slayer - <\/b>Matches are team-based and usually include 6 or 8 players in 3-on-3 or 4-on-4 games.

This is the most symmetrical of the small maps in the game, making it a common choice for people to use for 1 v 1 matches. A spiritual successor to Halo 2's Lockout, the changes made to it to make it a more compact map with ease of use for melee started a movement of people in the first few months of the games launch to constantly veto it whenever it game up. This happens even more so now with the release of Blackout (a Lockout remake) as part of the Legendary map pack.<\/p><h4>High Ground<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/138782\/2135823-high_ground_infobox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135823\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.60869565217391\" data-width=\"230\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 230px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/138782\/2135823-high_ground_infobox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135823\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/138782\/2135823-high_ground_infobox.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/138782\/2135823-high_ground_infobox.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>High Ground<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The first map in the game with vehicles, High Ground is a popular choice for One Flag, One Bomb, and other objective types due to the two oppositely balanced sides. The high ground team spawns next to a sniper tower with a Spartan Laser, and a couple of Mongooses for quick transportation. While the low ground spawns at the beach, next to a Ghost and the Sniper Rifle. This is a key map for the \"One\" objective types because it switches both teams between sides during each round.<\/p><h4>Isolation<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/138782\/2135836-isolation_infobox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135836\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.60869565217391\" data-width=\"230\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 230px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.9%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/138782\/2135836-isolation_infobox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2135836\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/138782\/2135836-isolation_infobox.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/138782\/2135836-isolation_infobox.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Isolation<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Isolation is a pretty symmetrical map made for Attack and Defend game types and Slayer types. The upper outdoor grassy level features a few Mongooses to get around, along with a Shotgun in the barricade in the center. The underground is where the map starts to really differentiate between other maps. Underground there are two large man cannons on each side to launch players back up the the main level. A Ghost in the middle for main vehicular control of the map. And a Rocket Launcher next to the Ghost.<\/p><h3>Ranks<\/h3><p style=\"\">Reaching different ranks requires the player to gain certain amounts of EXP and, for officer ranks, reach different skill levels. Skill levels are increased when the player wins ranked games. EXP is gained from simply winning games which can be either ranked or unranked. One EXP is gained from winning a game, zero is gained from losing a game and one EXP is lost for quitting out of a game early. The Ranks in increasing order are:<\/p><ol><li>Recruit grade 1<\/li><li>Apprentice Grade 1, Apprentice Grade 2<\/li><li>Private Grade 1, Private Grade 2<\/li><li>Corporal Grade 1, Corporal Grade 2<\/li><li>Sergeant Grade 1, Sergeant Grade 2, Sergeant Grade 3<\/li><li>Gunnery Sergeant Grade 1, Gunnery Sergeant Grade 2, Master Gunnery Sergeant<\/li><li>Lieutenant Grade 1, Lieutenant Grade 2, Lieutenant Grade 3, First Lieutenant<\/li><li>Captain Grade 1, Captain Grade 2, Captain Grade 3, Staff Captain<\/li><li>Major Grade 1, Major Grade 2, Major Grade 3, Field Major<\/li><li>Commander Grade 1, Commander Grade 2, Commander Grade 3, Strike Commander<\/li><li>Colonel Grade 1, Colonel Grade 2, Colonel Grade 3, Force Colonel<\/li><li>Brigadier Grade 1, Brigadier Grade 2, Brigadier Grade 3, Brigadier General<\/li><li>General Grade 1, General Grade 2, General Grade 3, 5 Star General<\/li><\/ol><h2>User-Generated Content<\/h2><h3>Forge<\/h3><p style=\"\">Main Article: <a href=\"\/forge\/3015-1929\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1929\">Forge<\/a><\/p><p style=\"\">With the addition of the new Forge mode, any Halo 3 owner can completely customize every Halo 3 multiplayer map. From vehicle and weapon placement to fusion coils and equipment placement, just about everything the player can use and interact with on a map can be moved, tweaked, and adjusted to the player's liking. Once completed, all forged maps can be put on the player's file share and uploaded to Bungie.net were other players can download, comment, tag, and share their creations over the Internet. The recent maps Foundry (From the Heroic Map Pack) and Sandbox (From the Mythic Map Pack) were made specifically to cater to users of Forge. Many forging communities have arisen in the wake of these two maps releases, creating a massive number of user-generated maps. Bungie has recently taken notice of this user-generated content and has incorporated several Forge maps created in Foundry and Sandbox into both Ranked and Social matchmaking. Bungie has also regularly featured maps created by the community in their weekly updates and included interviews with their creators. A few special features of the Forge have been included in recent map packs as well, from different color affects to the Killball.<\/p><h3>Theater<\/h3><p style=\"\">The Theater is a powerful tool allowing the viewing and saving of previously played campaign missions and multiplayer matches. The system used to create the video allows the video to maintain a size of mere kilobytes. The Theater can be used to take screenshots, save film clips, and save whole films. The camera in the Theater is not limited to a body either. The camera can be moved to any player or free-floated anywhere in the map, allowing for interesting angles and screenshots.<\/p><h3>Screenshots<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5978\/197338-32619830_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197338\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5978\/197338-32619830_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197338\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5978\/197338-32619830_full.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5978\/197338-32619830_full.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A User Created Screenshot<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">With the use of theater mode, users can take screenshots of their favorite moments and upload them to Bungie.net. There, players can also comment, rate, and download other users' screenshots. Bungie has used screenshots uploaded to Bungie.net in their Weekly updates.<\/p><h3>Saved Films<\/h3><p style=\"\">While watching a match in Theater, people can save entire custom and matchmaking games or cut out specific parts to make video clips. These videos can then be watched through Theater by anyone who has downloaded the file from the user's File Share. Plus, as the Theater records gameplay information and not video, matches can be viewed from any angle. Unfortunately, for the same reason, the Theater clips cannot be viewed online (although the Bungie Pro Video feature alleviates this problem, see below), although the player can set a video to download the next time they play Halo 3.<\/p><h3>File Share<\/h3><p style=\"\">The File Share is available for every Halo 3 user and allows them to upload their files for others to view and download at no cost. These slots can include Films, Film Clips, Screenshots, Map Variants, Gametypes or any combination. The standard capacity for the File Share is six slots and\/or 25MB, although this can be upgraded to 24 slots and 250MB via the pay service called Bungie Pro (see below).<\/p><h3>Bungie Pro<\/h3><p style=\"\">Bungie Pro enables a number of premium features to the Halo 3 user, including an expansion of storage for the Halo 3 File Share (see above) and the ability to use Bungie Pro Video (see below). A 12-Month Bungie Pro subscription can be purchased over Xbox Live for 750 MS Points. At the end of the subscription, the player will be asked to whether they want to renew their subscription or not. For a limited time, a trial of Bungie Pro was given as a gift to people who downloaded the Legendary Map Pack or Mythic Map Pack. The trial lasted roughly 4 months.<\/p><h3>Bungie Pro Video<\/h3><p style=\"\">As of now Bungie Pro comes bundled with Bungie Pro Video. Bungie Pro Video allows the player take their game film clips (which, as they are purely game data, require Halo 3 to be viewed) and turn them into videos they can watch on their computer using the .wmv format. Users are allowed 5 render minutes a month, which expire at the end of the month. Bungie has stated that users will soon be able to buy render minutes using the File Share menu at 10 minutes for 100 MSP ($1.25).<\/p><h2>Skulls<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/319\/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428990\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/319\/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428990\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/319\/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/319\/428990-26998835_medium.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A Halo 3 Skull<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Human <a href=\"\/skull\/3055-641\" data-ref-id=\"3055-641\">skulls<\/a> can be found tucked away in odd corners of the Halo 3 campaign. Each one has some kind of effect on the game that can be turned on or off at the beginning of a play session. In doing so, Bungie has expanded the original skulls \"Easter Egg\" from Halo 2. In Halo 3, when the player finds a skull they can turn it on and off at will, as opposed to having to start a new save to turn it off. There are four \"silver skulls\" which don't give an achievement but go towards unlocking the Hayabusa armor, and nine \"gold skulls\" which each have their own achievement and go towards unlocking the Hayabusa armor.<\/p><h3>Silver Skulls<\/h3><ul><li>Cowbell Skull - Makes explosions larger.<\/li><li>Grunt Birthday Party Skull - When Grunts are shot in the head, their head explodes and confetti flies out. There is also the sound of children cheering.<\/li><li>IWHBYD Skull - Activates new, often humorous dialogue in the game.<\/li><li>Blind Skull - Removes the reticule, shield bar, ammo count, etc. from the HUD.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Gold Skulls<\/h3><ul><li>Catch Skull - Makes enemies use grenades more often and also drop more when killed. Friendly units will also throw grenades more often.<\/li><li>Iron Skull - If playing the campaign singleplayer, death will send the player back to the beginning of the level. In co-op, the death of a single player takes all players back to the last checkpoint, similarly to playing Halo 2 on the Legendary difficulty.<\/li><li>Black Eye Skull - The shields don't recharge unless the player melees attack enemies.<\/li><li>Tough Luck Skull - Enemies are better at dodging explosions and vehicles.<\/li><li>Fog Skull - Removes the motion sensor.<\/li><li>Famine Skull - Makes dropped weapons supply with less ammo. This does not include weapons on weapon racks or certain weapons \"planted\" by Bungie for the player to use.<\/li><li>Thunderstorm Skull - Enemies' ranks are higher. Higher ranked enemies take more damage.<\/li><li>Tilt Skull - Enemies are more resistant to certain weapons. Even ordinarily, plasma weapons deal more damage to energy shields than to flesh, while the opposite is true for bullet-based weapons. With the skull on, shielded enemies will take dramatically less damage from bullet weapons and unshielded enemies will take dramatically less damage from plasma weapons. This includes vehicle weapons, such that a Plasma Rifle can take down a Brute's shields before a Warthog LAAG turret can, but this is much less noticeable in a tank.<\/li><li>Mythic Skull - Enemies have double health.<\/li><\/ul><p style=\"\">Guides are available on Giant Bomb to aid in locating each skull. Additionally, six more skulls were can be found in each multiplayer map added in the downloadable Mythic Map Pack, and also in the three maps be packed in with <a href=\"\/halo-3-odst\/3030-24035\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST<\/a>, with one skull per map. These skulls do not have any effects, and their only benefit is the Vidmaster achievement for finding all of them (meaning they are therefore required to achieve the coveted Recon armor).<\/p><h3>Multiplayer Map Skulls<\/h3><ul><li>Assembly Skull - This skull is located in the center of the map, up top, in between the big purple arm and the middle post. As with all the Mythic skulls, the player must be in Forge to obtain it.<\/li><li>Orbital Skull - This skull is located above the pit in the middle of the map, it is a few floors up and hidden under and overhang.

Previously, if two players melee'd each other at the same time, the player with more shielding would die and there was a two second window that the system considered \"same time.\" Due to the high level of complaints, Bungie came up with a new Melee system. The \"same time\" window was closed to about a second and the kill would often go to would hit first, but if the game determined that both players hit at the same time, both players would die, ending in a somewhat humorous death as both players flopped backwards.<\/p><h2>Title Update 2<\/h2><h3>Ranking<\/h3><p style=\"\">In their online Weekly Update for August 1st, 2008, Bungie unveiled a new addition to the online ranking system to be implemented in the second mandatory Title Update for Halo 3. The post included a chart illustrating EXP progression in various matchmaking playlists. The update offers players another visual representation of their progress in the online game, and serves to display precisely how many victories they have earned in any given matchmaking playlist.<\/p><p style=\"\">This is achieved by adding a new layer of specificity to the tracking of player EXP (EXP is a value that serves to illustrate how seasoned a player is in matchmade games). While a player's online Service Record still reflects their total EXP value, under the new ranking system, the player also has a visual EXP value (in the form of the same military ranks that previously existed in the online game) for each individual playlist. To clarify, this means that as a player wins more games in a particular playlist their overall EXP value responds as it normally would, but they also progress through the Halo 3 military ranks specific to that playlist. An example: A player may fancy the Team Slayer hopper over all others, and after some time and enough wins, obtain an EXP rank of General in the playlist -- however, if said player has only been competing in the Team Slayer playlist, they will have a playlist military rank of Recruit in the other playlists that they've been ignoring.<\/p><p style=\"\">A common misconception among Halo fans after the announcement of this news was that the hard-fought rankings that they had toiled away for since first setting foot online would be made meaningless after the release of the update, because now any player who invested enough time in a certain playlist would reach the esteemed upper ranks in a much easier fashion. This concern was later proven to be immaterial, because no aspect of the previous ranking system was being modified, and the individual playlist rankings were not to be reflected in a player's Service Record.<\/p><h3>Map Variants<\/h3><p style=\"\">The Title Update also introduced four new variants of existing maps, out of Epitaph came Epilogue, and out of Snowbound came Boundless. While Epilogue is entirely without shield doors, Boundless still has those in High and Low base middle entrances (to counter the possibility of grenade spamming). These new maps will replace the existing ones; they will appear in matchmaking simultaneously, however in the long run Bungie hopes to have these maps become the dominant set. In addition to these two, Sand Tarp is now a version of Sand Trap without the Elephant vehicle and with new flag capture spaces. Pit Stop is a new version of The Pit with the upper spawn areas now inaccessible. These same matchmaking policies apply to these two as well. These maps are treated as Forge variants by the game, and can therefore be played normally and saved to an Xbox 360 Hard Drive.<\/p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation<\/h2><p style=\"\">Halo 3 requires 5.7 GB of HDD space to be installed. However, Bungie has recommended players to not install the game, saying that due to optimizations made to the game (so that it can be played on Xbox 360 consoles with no HDD attached), playing an installed copy (either through the installation process or through Games on Demand) causes longer loading times when playing multiplayer.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"id":9993,"image":{"icon_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_avatar\/8\/87790\/2079826-box_halo3.png","medium_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/87790\/2079826-box_halo3.png","screen_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/screen_medium\/8\/87790\/2079826-box_halo3.png","small_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2079826-box_halo3.png","super_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_large\/8\/87790\/2079826-box_halo3.png","thumb_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_avatar\/8\/87790\/2079826-box_halo3.png","tiny_url":"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/square_mini\/8\/87790\/2079826-box_halo3.png"},"name":"Halo 3","number_of_user_reviews":100,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-16\/","id":16,"name":"ESRB: M"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-5\/","id":5,"name":"BBFC: 15"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-31\/","id":31,"name":"OFLC: M"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-2\/","id":2,"name":"PEGI: 16+"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-32\/","id":32,"name":"CERO: D"}],"original_release_date":"2007-09-25 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-20\/","id":20,"name":"Xbox 360","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/","abbreviation":"X360"},{"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-86\/","id":86,"name":"Xbox 360 Games Store","site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/xbox-360-games-store\/3045-86\/","abbreviation":"XBGS"}],"site_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/halo-3\/3030-9993\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"http:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-26786\/","date_added":"2009-06-01 09:59:24","date_last_updated":"2014-10-08 05:49:57","deck":"Halo: Reach is the prequel to Halo: Combat Evolved, and chronicles one of the most cataclysmic events of the Halo Universe, the destruction of the UNSC fortress world Reach, through the eyes of a squad of Spartan super-soldiers known as Noble Team.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7580\/1471664-noble_team.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471664\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.49367088607595\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.4%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7580\/1471664-noble_team.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1471664\"><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7580\/1471664-noble_team.jpeg\"><\/a><figcaption>The player's companions, making up the rest of the elite Noble Team.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Halo: Reach is a first-person shooter developed by <a href=\"\/bungie-studios\/3010-476\" data-ref-id=\"3010-476\">Bungie<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/microsoft-game-studios\/3010-340\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a> on September 14, 2010. It is a direct prequel to <a href=\"\/halo-combat-evolved\/3030-2600\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo: Combat Evolved<\/a> and chronicles the destruction of <a href=\"\/reach\/3035-571\" data-ref-id=\"3035-571\">Reach<\/a>, a world used as headquarters for the <a href=\"\/united-nations-space-command\/3015-3859\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">United Nations Space Command<\/a>, in the late summer of 2552. Players control the customizable <a href=\"\/spartan-312\/3005-13970\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13970\">Spartan-312<\/a>, known as Noble Six, in an elite team of <a href=\"\/spartan\/3015-666\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">Spartan<\/a> super-soldiers known as <a href=\"\/noble-team\/3015-5853\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5853\">Noble Team<\/a>. Halo: Reach ret conned certain aspects of the novel, <em>Halo: The Fall of Reach<\/em> such as the amount of Spartans in the SPARTAN II project. Furthermore, it introduced Brutes much earlier in the timeline from whence they were originally brought in (Halo 2). <\/p><p style=\"\">The game is built off of the same engine used in <a href=\"\/halo-3\/3030-9993\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\">Halo 3<\/a> and <a href=\"\/halo-3-odst\/3030-24035\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\">Halo 3: ODST<\/a>, having full feature parity while including new features and improving existing ones. A new ranking system allows players to earn \"credits\" (cR) by playing both single-player and multi-player games, which both tracks their rank and allows them to further customize their Spartan armor.<\/p><p style=\"\">Players who owned a copy of Halo 3: ODST were invited to a multiplayer beta of Halo: Reach, which ran from May 3, 2010 to May 20, 2010. (Though an internal group had access beginning on April 29, 2010) The beta included four maps (Boneyard, Overlook, Powerhouse, and Sword Base) and a variety of new and existing gametypes. Microsoft promoted Halo: Reach through viral marketing campaigns \"Birth of a Spartan\" and \"Remember Reach\". The game was also promoted by Mountain Dew and Doritos via a special sweepstakes, in which players win the game, Xbox 360, or promotional material such as a working replica Mongoose ATV.<\/p><p style=\"\">Halo: Reach is the last Bungie-developed game in the <a href=\"\/halo\/3025-2\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">Halo<\/a> franchise. Now 343 Industries holds the title, with their first original entry in the series being <a href=\"\/halo-4\/3030-35533\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35533\">Halo 4<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p style=\"\">Halo: Reach remains very close in style to its predecessors in terms of movement and aiming. The combination of <a href=\"\/regenerating-health\/3015-83\" data-ref-id=\"3015-83\">regenerating health<\/a> (in which health regenerates up to the nearest third) and <a href=\"\/shield-regeneration\/3015-2349\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2349\">regenerating shields<\/a> returns from Halo: Combat Evolved, requiring players to pick up <a href=\"\/health-pack\/3055-255\" data-ref-id=\"3055-255\">health packs<\/a> when needed. Unlike the previous Halo games, shields now must be fully depleted in order for players to take health damage (though certain attacks negate it). The ability to <a href=\"\/dual-wielding\/3015-135\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">dual wield<\/a> weapons has been removed altogether (though A.I. Elites sometimes akimbo Plasma Rifles).<\/p><h3>Armor Abilities<\/h3><p style=\"\">New to Halo: Reach is the concept of Armor Abilities, which grant skills that can be activated by pressing a certain button (left bumper by default). This is a general replacement of equipment from Halo 3, though the Bubble Shield returns as the Drop Shield Armor Ability. In Campaign levels, the player starts with the Sprint ability, and can only replace it by finding armor abilities throughout the level. In all other modes, the player's armor ability is determined by which loadout they use. Each armor ability have different <a href=\"\/cooldowns\/3015-2589\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2589\">cooldown<\/a> timers that prevent the player from using the ability until it has recharged fully or to a specific percentage.<\/p><ul><li><b>Sprint<\/b> - Causes players to run faster for a short period of time. However, this lowers their weapon, preventing them from firing from the hip.<\/li><li><b>Evade<\/b> - Causes players to perform a quick roll that breaks lock-on from certain weapons.<\/li><li><b>Armor Lock<\/b> - Causes players to become completely invulnerable (at the cost of being immovable and unable to fire weapons). Enemies close to the player have their shields removed from the <a href=\"\/electromagnetic-pulse\/3015-4910\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4910\">EMP<\/a> burst.<\/li><li><b>Jet Pack<\/b> - Propels player into the air (until it runs out of fuel\/needs to recharge) .<\/li><li><b>Active Camo<\/b> - Makes the player nearly invisible. However, the faster they move, the more visible they are. Active Camo also disrupts enemy radar (along with the player's radar) with extra random blips. Audio becomes muffled as well.<\/li><li><b>Hologram<\/b> - Creates a hologram of the player which can be used to distract enemies. The hologram walks wherever the player has their reticle pointed at and disappears after being fired upon too much (or after a certain amount of time).<\/li><li><b>Drop Shield<\/b> - Creates a blue-tinted bubble shield around the player's location, blocking all weapon fire. The shield also heals the player and all teammates inside, and can be destroyed by taking too much damage.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Loadouts<\/h3><p style=\"\">Loadouts in multiplayer and Firefight modes determine which armor ability, weapons, and grenades the player can start with. They can be switched during the respawn window or during the start of the match. Loadouts cannot be customized for matchmaking, as they are restricted into each gametype. Players can only choose from up to five loadouts at a time. In Invasion gametypes, Spartans and Elites can have their own loadout selection, which change according to how far the game has progressed. O<\/p><h3>Playable Elites<\/h3><p style=\"\">Unlike Halo 2 and Halo 3, in which picking an Elite is a pure aesthetic choice, playable Elites in Halo: Reach are now faster, stronger, and bigger than Spartans. They do not need to use health packs, as their health fully regenerates. Because of these differences, Elites are only playable in Elite Slayer or Invasion (in the Elite team).<\/p><h3>Assassination<\/h3><p style=\"\">New to Halo: Reach, holding down the melee button when attacking someone from behind triggers a third-person animation, depicting the player silently killing the enemy with a knife or plasma sword, depending on their species. Neither player is invulnerable during this animation, and quick players can either rescue those who are being assassinated or steal the kill by killing the player being assassinated. A assassination can change or not even happen if you aren't looking at the right angle.<\/p><h3>Weapon Reticles<\/h3><p style=\"\">All weapons in Halo: Reach are now subject to reticle bloom. The reticle now gets larger as a weapon is repeatedly fired, showing their worsened accuracy. In order to maintain consistent accuracy, players must wait for the reticle to return to normal size after a short delay. Crouching reduces this bloom. Certain weapons also have a \" <a href=\"\/ghost-reticle\/3015-5102\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5102\">ghost reticle<\/a>\", which assists players by showing how far ahead the player needs to aim to hit a target.<\/p><h3>Space Combat<\/h3><p style=\"\">New to Halo: Reach is the concept of space combat. In two sections of \"Long Night of Solace\", players pilot a YSS-1000 space craft (known as a Sabre), fighting Banshees, Seraphs, and Phantoms before disabling a Corvette. The Sabre is very mobile, similar to the Banshee, and have both regenerating health and shields. Players can choose between a machine gun cannon and homing missile launchers.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h3>UNSC Weapons<\/h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"\/designated-marksman-rifle\/3055-3531\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3531\">Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR)<\/a><\/b> - A mid to long ranged single shot rifle. It takes 5 shots to kill a fully-shielded Spartan and 6 shots to kill an Elite. Essentially a superior version of the old Battle Rifle.<\/li><li><b><a href=\"\/m6c-magnum\/3055-2807\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2807\">M6C Magnum<\/a><\/b> - Like its <i>Halo:CE<\/i> counter part it can be very lethal. Takes 5 shots to kill a spartan and 6 to kill an elite. This is a mid to close range weapon. It has a higher rate of fire than the DMR but it is less accurate and more subject to reticle bloom.<\/li><li><b><a href=\"\/ma5c-assault-rifle\/3055-116\" data-ref-id=\"3055-116\">MA5C Assault Rifle<\/a><\/b> - Very similar to the model in <i>Halo 3<\/i>, except that it now has weapon bloom, and short bursts are more accurate at long range.<\/li><li><b><a href=\"\/m41-rocket-launcher\/3055-134\" data-ref-id=\"3055-134\">M41 Rocket Launcher<\/a><\/b> - Similar to <i>Halo 3<\/i>, yet the vehicle targeting from Halo 2 is back (only against ground vehicles). Also immune to shield pop.<\/li><li><b><a href=\"\">M45 Tactical Shotgun<\/a><\/b> - Farther reach than the shotguns in previous Halo games as not all shots stay within the reticle, immune to the requirement of a shield pop at close range.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/m319-grenade-launcher\/3055-3657\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3657\"><b>M319 Grenade Launcher<\/b><\/a> - If it hits its target it explodes. If it does not it bounces around like a frag for a short delay, then explodes. If you hold the trigger after you fire it will act as a remote detonation and explode when you release the trigger. The grenade also lets out a small EMP blast disabling jet packs, vehicles and the such.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/srs99d-sniper-rifle\/3055-113\" data-ref-id=\"3055-113\"><b>SRS99D Sniper Rifle<\/b><\/a> - Appears the same as <i>Halo 3<\/i>, now has a weapon bloom effect that appears to be primarily as an indicator of when the next shot can be fired. Immune to the shield pop requirement.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/h-165-fom-target-locator\/3055-5316\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5316\"><b>H-165 FOM (Target Locator)<\/b><\/a> - After a charge time and orbital bombardment comes from the sky and destroys anything in its radius. Can be used to paint either a wide area or individual targets. Only available in Campaign or Firefight modes.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Covenant Weapons<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/plasma-repeater\/3055-3543\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3543\"><b>Plasma Repeater<\/b><\/a> - The Covenant version of the assault rifle. It sends out a steady stream of plasma. Fire rate slows as it heats up but never overheats, as fire rate slows, accuracy increases. Pressing the reload button will cool it down and bring it back up to speed. Able to be partially cooled, and cooling can occur during melees and grenade throws.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/plasma-launcher\/3055-3603\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3603\"><b>Plasma Launcher<\/b><\/a> - It fires off 1 to 4 rounds of plasma bombs depending on how long you hold the trigger: The plasma will lock on to both people and vehicles with a similar lock on as a needler. The shots stick to people and vehicles like plasma grenades.<\/li><li><b><a href=\"\/focus-rifle\/3055-3544\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3544\">Focus Rifle<\/a><\/b> - If the beam rifle and the sentinel beam had a baby this would be it. It a zoomable laser that drains health and shields very quickly. At the current build, it takes about 1.5 seconds to kill a target.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/needle-rifle\/3055-3545\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3545\"><b>Needle Rifle<\/b><\/a> - Covenant equivalent to the DMR. Fires very long needles, if three needles stick to an unshielded opponent, a super-combine explosion occurs like the needler, it is a one-shot <a href=\"\">headshot<\/a> kill on an unshielded opponent as well. It is less inaccurate than the DMR when fired quickly, but does less damage with each individual shot.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/plasma-pistol\/3055-119\" data-ref-id=\"3055-119\"><b>Plasma Pistol<\/b><\/a> - Now carries an <a href=\"\">area of effect<\/a> component that allows the charged shot to hit multiple targets. It takes from 7 to 10 shots to kill a fully shielded Spartan player.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/needler\/3055-135\" data-ref-id=\"3055-135\"><b>Needler<\/b><\/a> - Improved tracking compared to it's Halo 3 version. Also features the \"ghost reticle\" effect. Shields must be down before a super combine will occur.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/energy-sword\/3055-115\" data-ref-id=\"3055-115\"><b>Energy Sword<\/b><\/a> - Similar to Halo 3, but it can now be countered by a normal melee strike.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/concussion-rifle\/3055-4485\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4485\"><b>Concussion Rifle<\/b><\/a> - An Elite equivalent of the <a href=\"\/brute-shot\/3055-123\" data-ref-id=\"3055-123\">Brute Shot<\/a>, fires a large ball of plasma that explodes on impact.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/plasma-rifle\/3055-122\" data-ref-id=\"3055-122\"><b>Plasma Rifle<\/b><\/a> - The iconic Covenant weapon from all of the past Halo games returns in Reach.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/gravity-hammer\/3055-128\" data-ref-id=\"3055-128\"><b>Gravity Hammer<\/b><\/a> - No changes from Halo 3.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/brute-spike-rifle\/3055-139\" data-ref-id=\"3055-139\"><b>Brute Spike Rifle (Spiker)<\/b><\/a> - A returning weapon from Halo 3. No noticeable changes made. It is good in close range for taking down shields, though short, controlled bursts are recommended for medium to long range. Its projectiles have a slight arc, so you should aim higher when firing at longer ranged targets.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/fuel-rod-cannon\/3055-923\" data-ref-id=\"3055-923\"><b>Fuel Rod Cannon<\/b><\/a> - Covenant equivalent to the rocket launcher.

That evolution involves many of the changes detailed above. Halo: Reach multiplayer contains <a href=\"\/mjolnir-armor\/3055-33\" data-ref-id=\"3055-33\">Armor Abilities<\/a> that modify the Spartan or Elite armor allowing for different style of play from each player. Additionally, Reach brings back the idea of Halo 2's Y menu with the addition of Active Rosters. Most multiplayer maps were actually designed and then placed into campaign. Elites return to multiplayer with very different characteristics. Most noticeably, Elites are significantly bigger than Spartans - for example, in a crouched position, they are nearly as tall as a standing Spartan. In addition, Elites default run speed is almost as fast as a Spartan using the Sprint Armor Ability. Further differences from previous Halo games MP include, Spartan non-regenerative health, Elite regenerative health, and species specific Armor Abilities and Loadouts. Despite pre-release rumors, multiplayer is not strictly class based, however, the addition of Loadouts, granting players the ability to choose what Armor Ability and weapons they can start the match and re-spawn with, makes it very close to a class based system.<\/p><h3>Competitive Multiplayer Maps<\/h3><ul><li><strong>Anchor 9 (Noble Map Pack) -<\/strong> A small map set in a UNSC space station for refueling and rearming various ships. The outer portion of the map is actually in space and features reduced gravity compared to the rest of the map. It is optimized for 4v4 play and is reminiscent of Halo 3's \"The Pit\" map.<\/li><li><b>Battle Canyon (Anniversary Map Pack)<\/b> - A remake of the popular Halo 2 map <a href=\"\/beaver-creek\/3035-3507\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3507\">Beaver Creek<\/a>. While most of Battle Canyon is a faithful recreation of the previous incarnation of the map, there are some notable changes in the geometry. Tunnels have been added at either end of the creek in the center of the map, and small caves have been added behind each base.<\/li><li><strong>Boardwalk<\/strong> - A long map used in almost all matchmaking playlists for various gametypes.<\/li><li><strong>Boneyard<\/strong> - The map is specifically designed for the new Invasion gametype, which is speculated to be a 6v6 variant featuring one team of Spartans against one team of Elites. It is a large map that allows for areas to be progressively opened as the match progresses. The map is set around the construction yard of a UNSC space frigate.<\/li><li><b>Breakneck (Anniversary Map Pack)<\/b> - A remake of <a href=\"\/headlong\/3035-2357\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2357\">Headlong<\/a> from Halo 2.<\/li><li><b>Breakpoint (Noble Map Pack)<\/b> - The largest of the first three DLC maps is set in a cliff-side UNSC research installation near a Forerunner artifact. It is designed around the Invasion gametype, but will also support Big Team Battle. The Invasion scenario puts the Spartans on defense against the Elites, which are on offense.<\/li><li><b>Condemned (Defiant Map Pack)<\/b> - A medium-sized indoor map set in a Human space station overlooking the battle of Reach from orbit. Best suited for Team Slayer and small-scale objective gametypes. Contains a zone of reduced gravity in the center of the map, similar to Anchor 9.<\/li><li><b>Countdown -<\/b> This symmetrical map is set in a UNSC base and features a shotgun, Concussion Rifle, and Energy Sword.<\/li><li><b>Highlands (Defiant Map Pack)<\/b> - A large-scale outdoor map set in a Spartan training facility on Reach. Used primarily in Big Team gametypes.<\/li><li><b>High Noon (Anniversary Map Pack)<\/b> - A remake of <a href=\"\/hang-em-high\/3035-2848\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2848\">Hang 'Em High<\/a> from Halo: CE.<\/li><li><b>Penance (Anniversary Map Pack)<\/b> - A remake of <a href=\"\/damnation\/3035-1995\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1995\">Damnation<\/a> from Halo: CE.<\/li><li><strong>Powerhouse<\/strong> - A former hydroelectric station that has since been put to use by the UNSC military. Powerhouse is designed to support small-team games, such as Slayer. The default map variant features plenty of weapon variety. There are several DMRs, Magnums, Plasma Pistols, Needlers, and Needle Rifles scattered about the map. There are also some important power weapons available: a Gravity Hammer, a Focus Rifle, and a Rocket Launcher<b>.<\/b><\/li><li><b>Reflection<\/b> - A remake of <a href=\"\/ivory-tower\/3035-2356\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2356\">Ivory Tower<\/a> from Halo 2.<\/li><li><b>Ridgeline (Anniversary Map Pack)<\/b> - A remake of <a href=\"\/timberland\/3035-2863\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2863\">Timberland<\/a> from Halo PC.<\/li><li><b>Solitary (Anniversary Map Pack)<\/b> - A remake of Prisoner from Halo: CE. The new version of the map contains gravity lifts in place of ladders, and adds a few new corridors in the upper levels of the map for increased movement options.<\/li><li><b>Spire<\/b> - The game on Spire relies heavily on air combat. It has 16 player Invasion.<\/li><li><b>Swordbase<\/b> - With a design inspired by a pair of fan favorite maps from Halo: Combat Evolved, Prisoner and Boarding Action, this map is small and asymmetrical -- perfectly-suited for Slayer and one-sided Objective matches. There are three power weapons available for players to fight over: an Energy Sword, a Plasma Launcher, and a Sniper Rifle.<\/li><li><b>Tempest (Noble Map Pack)<\/b> - A mid-sized map, set on the Halo ring, that supports almost every gametype and size. It is reminiscent of Halo 3's Valhalla and features functional symmetry, vehicles and numerous power weapons.<\/li><li><b>Zealot<\/b> - A Covenant themed map drawing map\/aesthetic design cues from Midship, though is significantly different in layout. The largest difference being the large third floor that takes place in space. This allows for zero-gravity combat and quick travel from one side of the map to the other.<\/li><\/ul><h3><b>The Arena<\/b><\/h3><p style=\"\">Ranked matches in Halo 3 were plagued with boosters - high level players who would create second accounts to start out at rank 1 and take advantage of poorer players on their way back up the ladder to level 50. To prevent that problem from happening in Reach Bungie has replaced ranked matches with a new playlist - the Arena.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Arena is broken up into month long seasons. Each season players can place within one of 5 divisions. The divisions are Onyx, Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. The players division rank for each season will stay with their gaming history. In interviews Bungie has compared players divisional placement history to the stats on the back of a baseball card. This provides an incentive to stay with one account so not to lose that history. Moreover, divisional assignments are made rather quickly, so a high level player will be playing other high level players within just a few days of the start of a new season.<\/p><p style=\"\">To place in a division players will have to play a minimum number of matches over a minimum number of days. Players need to complete 3 Arena matches in a day in order to receive a Daily Ranking. The player is assigned to a division after receiving 3 daily rankings.<\/p><p style=\"\">The players daily ranking will be based on the three best matches they played during that day. And the seasonal ranking will be based on the players three best daily rankings throughout the month. Therefore, once your divisional assignment is complete, you can only climb in the rankings. Once your divisional assignment is made no amount of bad play can lower your ranking, but a day or two of great play can increase your ranking.<\/p><p style=\"\">The players ranking for each match will be based on how well they play as a member of a team. No longer will assists and K\/D ratios be discounted in favor of pure kills. A player with 0 kills, 5 assists and 5 deaths will receive a higher ranking than the player who got 20 kills, no assists, and 20 deaths. Being on a winning team still matters, but now if you are the only player on the losing team that went positive, you\u2019ll be rewarded and may even get a higher rating than some under performing members of the winning team.<\/p><h3>Forge 2.0<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1447806\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/669\/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1447806\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/669\/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/669\/1447806-8_reach_vidoc_3_forge_world_esrb_720pst_046.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Welcome to Forge World<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Forge has seen significant changes from the forge mode in Halo 3. The mode remains purely an object editor without terrain editing. However, the built-in structures allow one to create much more complicated levels than Halo 3's Sandbox or Foundry. The most important new feature is the ability to change an objects physical property from normal (object is affected by gravity like Halo 3), fixed (object is not affected by gravity), and phased (object now has no collision detection and can be pushed through walls and other objects). Each piece has further useful settings such as increasing the effective radius and shape of a teleporter or changing the color of the object to match team specifications. Several of maps that come on disc are direct remakes of older Halo maps, and each shows the variety of maps that can be produced in the new Forge.<\/p><h3>On-disc Forge World Map Variants<\/h3><ul><li><b>Hemorrhage<\/b> - Coagulation\/ Blood Gulch remake.<\/li><li><b>Paradiso<\/b> - Unique map created on The Island in Forge World.<\/li><li><b>Pinnacle<\/b> - Remake of Ascension from Halo 2.<\/li><li><b>The Cage<\/b> - A map originally intended for Halo: CE, The Cage is a precursor to Lockout and Guardian and features many of the same design elements, such as narrow walkways and long sight lines.<\/li><li><b>Asylum<\/b> - Remake of Sanctuary, a Halo 2 map.<\/li><li><b>Grifball Court<\/b> - A standard arena court for the popular community variant Grifball, built in the Coliseum section of Forge World.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Patch added Forge World Map Variants<\/h3><ul><li>Atom<\/li><li>Cliffhanger<\/li><\/ul><h3>Multiplayer Matchmaking<\/h3><ul><li>Arena - A set of playlists, such as Free-for-All and Team Slayer that are similar to the Ranked Playlists of the Halo 3. The Arena uses a new rating system that counts other factors than wins to rank the player in 5 divisions in month long seasons. Players can move up or down in the season divisions, and play players in their division. They are then ranked in their division, and to qualify for a \"daily ranking\" players can also play a certain number of matches in a day.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Active Roster - Active Roster takes much of the information that was in the Halo 3 players' profiles under \"Halo 3 Party\" and puts it on the main menus. This tells the player his\/her friends' current parties, games being played in, score and remaining time.<\/li><li>Queue Joining - Allows the player to wait in a lobby for a friend, rather than wait for a match to end to join a friend, as in Halo 3, or actually join the match, as in Modern Warfare 2.<\/li><li>Veto 2.0 - Gives the players three maps and gametypes to choose from in the lobby for the players to vote on.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>New Party-Up System - After a match, all players are kept in a lobby to move into the next match together, rather than looking for new players every time. There is an opt-out to still go into a brand new lobby.<\/li><li>New Preferences System - The game now has a preferences system for Chattiness, Motivation, Teamwork, and Tone<\/li><\/ul><h2>Persistent Stats<\/h2><p style=\"\">Halo: Reach improves upon the persistent experience of Halo 3.<\/p><h3>Experience System<\/h3><p style=\"\">The experience system used in Halo: Reach uses \"Credits\" (abbreviated to cR), which can be earned in a variety of ways in all game modes (after finishing the match):<\/p><ul><li><b>Game Completion<\/b> - Completing the match (or exiting out of a non-matchmaking match) earns all players the same amount of cR. (Which varies according to game mode and match duration)<\/li><li><b>Commendations<\/b> - Commendations are given by earning medals (given under special circumstances) in the match. Players also earn cR through special awards (known formally as Commendations) that are tracked among all games the player has played on that mode (Campaign, Multiplayer Matchmaking, and Firefight Matchmaking).<\/li><li><b>Challenges<\/b> - Each day brings four new Daily Challenges, which gives players a specific task to perform (such as completing a Campaign level on a certain difficulty with certain skulls on or killing a certain number of players in Matchmaking). Each week also brings one Weekly Challenge, which gives a harder, more demanding challenge.<\/li><li><b>Slot Machine<\/b> - Matchmaking only. A random bonus is given to each player, usually around 100 cR.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Credits<\/h3><p style=\"\">Players are ranked according to how much \"Credits\" they collect throughout their entire Halo: Reach career. Buying things from the Armory does not reduce the player's amount of experience or rank. Once players reach certain ranks, more gear is unlocked (or uncovered) in the Armory.<\/p><h3>Commendations<\/h3><p style=\"\">Commendations are special awards that players earn throughout their Halo: Reach career. Performing certain actions multiple times increase their Commendation's level. When the level gauge is filled, their Commendations upgrade and the player receives cR. The Commendations list in each player's service record is sorted by the most upgraded Commendation. There are six milestones in each Commendation, each with their own emblem. (Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Onyx, and maximum Onyx) There is a total of 45 Commendations, split into three different categories: Campaign (green Commendations), Multiplayer Matchmaking (blue Commendations), and Firefight Matchmaking (red Commendations).<\/p><ul><li><b>Cannon Fodder (Campaign) \/ Target Practice (Firefight)<\/b> - Kill an Infantry-class enemy.<\/li><li><b>Close Quarters (Multiplayer)<\/b> - Kill an enemy in close-quarters combat (Melee, Shotgun, Energy Sword, Gravity Hammer).<\/li><li><b>Demon (Campaign)<\/b> - Complete a Campaign mission.<\/li><li><b>Downshift (Multiplayer)<\/b> - Be the driver of a vehicle while a passenger on a mounted weapon kills an enemy.<\/li><li><b>Flawless Cowboy (Campaign) \/ Perfectionist (Firefight)<\/b> - Complete a Campaign mission (on Heroic or Legendary) or a Firefight Matchmaking round without dying.<\/li><li><b>Jack of All Trades (Multiplayer)<\/b> - Earn a specific medal.

Halo 2, they were only to show that the player is a Bungie.net member or a Bungie employee. While nameplates can still only be changed through a Bungie.net, they can be customized in one of 13 different options:<\/p><ul><li><b>Blank<\/b> - Default.<\/li><li><b>Septagon<\/b> - Unlocked once the gamertag is linked to a Bungie.net account.<\/li><li><b>DMR<\/b> - Unlocked by subscribing to the Bungie Pro service.<\/li><li><b>Marathon<\/b> - Unlocked by playing the full version of the Xbox Live Arcade version of <a href=\"\/marathon-2-durandal\/3030-1921\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1921\">Marathon: Durandal<\/a>.<\/li><li><b>Halo 1<\/b> - Unlocked by entering a product key for the PC or Mac version of Halo: Combat Evolved.<\/li><li><b>Halo 2<\/b> - Unlocked by playing the Xbox version of Halo 2 before April 14, 2010.<\/li><li><b>Halo 3<\/b> - Unlocked by playing Halo 3.<\/li><li><b>Halo 3: ODST<\/b> - Unlocked by playing Halo 3: ODST.<\/li><li><b>Assault Rifle<\/b> - Unlocked by playing the Halo: Reach beta.<\/li><li><b>HALO<\/b> - Unlocked after earning the Halo 1, Halo 2, and Halo 3 emblems.<\/li><li><b>Spartan Helmet<\/b> - Unlocked after earning four of the following emblems: Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Assault Rifle.<\/li><li><b>Star<\/b> - Unlocked by participating in \"Bungie All Star\" community challenges on Bungie.net and having your entry chosen by the community manager.<\/li><li><b>Bungie<\/b> - Bungie employees only.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Official Gametypes<\/h2><p style=\"\">Halo: Reach has 12 multiplayer gametypes and one gametype specifically made for Forge, each customizable in many ways. Some official Bungie gametypes are not built-in to the game and must be downloaded from either a search or by playing that gametype in Matchmaking. The VIP gametype from Halo 3 has been removed, as well as most gametype variations from previous Halo games.<\/p><p style=\"\">Only Slayer and Elite Slayer have indestructible vehicles. By default, players start with the Assault Rifle and Magnum and have five loadouts: Sprint, Armor Lock, Active Camo, Hologram, and Drop Shield.<\/p><h3>Slayer (originated in Halo: Combat Evolved)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Slayer<\/b> - Default <a href=\"\/deathmatch\/3015-451\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch<\/a> mode. Kill or be killed. Suicides and betrayals decrease your score. Active Camo is replaced with Jet Pack.<\/li><li><b>Slayer Pro<\/b> - Slayer for more hardcore players. Players choose one of two loadouts: Marksman (starts with the DMR and two frag grenades) or Warden (starts with the Needle Rifle and two plasma grenades). Players can only use the Sprint armor ability. Motion tracker is disabled. Vehicles are limited to Mongooses. All weapon locations are replaced with a special \"Arena Standard\" set.<\/li><li><b>Classic Slayer<\/b> - Slayer reminiscent of previous Halo games. No loadouts or armor abilities.<\/li><li><b>Elite Slayer<\/b> - Slayer with Elites only. All weapon locations are replaced with Covenant weapons. Players start with two plasma grenades (and a Plasma Pistol as a secondary weapon) and have access to five loadouts: Zealot (Evade with a Needle Rifle), Dark Assassin (Active Camo with a Needler), Deceiver (Hologram with a Plasma Repeater), Saboteur (Armor Lock with a Needler), and Ranger (Jet Pack with a Plasma Repeater).<\/li><li><b>SWAT<\/b> - Originally a custom gametype in Halo 2 and a special playlist in Halo 3, SWAT limits the players' arsenals to DMRs and Magnums. Grenades, motion trackers, shields, and loadouts are disabled. Players can only use the Sprint armor ability, have 200% damage resistance and have infinite ammo. This is announced in the beginning of the game as \"SWAT\" instead of \"Slayer\".<\/li><li><b>Slayer DMRs<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>Snipers<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>Snipers Pro<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>Big Team Slayer<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>BTB Classic<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>BTB Snipers<\/b> (not included)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Oddball (originated in Halo: Combat Evolved)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Oddball<\/b> - Players (or teams) must pick up and hold on to the Oddball to earn points. Players carrying a ball have 25% less speed, cannot drive vehicles, have a disabled motion tracker, and have a waypoint that's visible to everybody else.<\/li><li><b>Hot Potato<\/b> (not included)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Capture the Flag (originated in Halo: Combat Evolved)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Capture the Flag<\/b> - 2-4 teams. Each team has a flag. Players must guard their team's flag while grabbing the flags of enemies and bringing them back to their base. Dropped flags take 30 seconds to respawn (or 15 seconds to return if an ally is standing on it). Players carrying a flag have 25% less speed, cannot drive vehicles, and have a waypoint that's only visible to allies. Teams must have their flags safe at their base in order to score.<\/li><li><b>Multi Flag CTF<\/b> - No difference.<\/li><li><b>Neutral Flag CTF<\/b> - Same as Capture The Flag, only instead of each team having their own flag, only one flag is placed in the middle of the map (which anybody can grab).<\/li><li><b>One Flag CTF<\/b> - Two teams. Each team take turns as Attackers and Defenders. Defenders have the flag and has three minutes to guard it. The round ends when the time is up or the flag is captured. Dropped flags take 30 seconds to respawn, regardless of whoever is near it.<\/li><li><b>One Flag Pro<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>One Flag Classic<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>Two Flag Pro<\/b> (not included)<\/li><li><b>Two Flag Classic<\/b> (not included)<\/li><\/ul><h3>King of the Hill (originated in Halo: Combat Evolved)<\/h3><ul><li><b>King of the Hill<\/b> - A \"hill\" (essentially a marked area) is placed somewhere in the map. Players earn points by being the only player or team standing in the hill. Players cannot use their armor abilities while inside the hill.<\/li><li><b>Crazy King<\/b> - Same as King of the Hill, only the hill is moved to a random location every 30 seconds.<\/li><li><b>Crazy King Pro<\/b> (not included)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Race (originated in Halo: Combat Evolved)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Race<\/b> - Players race Mongooses, Ghosts, Warthogs, or Banshees around a set of pre-determined zones. Going through all the zones count as a \"lap\". Land mines, which knock vehicles around, can be scattered throughout the course. Players who get off their vehicle have a Sprint ability and are nearly-invulnerable, but gets on a teleported vehicle after some time. There are no grenades or loadouts.<\/li><li><b>Rally<\/b> - Same as Race, only players earn points by being the first at a random location (which moves after a player enters it with a vehicle). Unlike Race, players can use grenades and can die like normal.<\/li><li><b>Rocket Race<\/b> (not included) - This gametype has a unique icon.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Assault (originated in Halo 2)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Assault<\/b> - Two teams, each with their own bomb. Players must pick up their team's bomb, take it to the enemy's base (shown as a waypoint) and protect it until it detonates, all while protecting their own base from enemy bombs. Players carrying a bomb have 25% less speed and cannot drive vehicles. It takes 5 seconds for the bomb to arm, 10 seconds for the bomb to detonate, 5 seconds for the bomb to be disarmed by the enemy, and 30 seconds for dropped bombs to return.<\/li><li><b>Neutral Bomb Assault<\/b> - Same as Assault, only instead of each team having their own bomb, only one bomb is placed in the middle of the map (which anybody can grab).<\/li><li><b>One Bomb Assault<\/b> - Each team take turns as Attackers and Defenders. Attackers have the bomb and has three minutes to plant it. The round ends when the time is up or the bomb is detonated.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Juggernaut (originated in Halo 2)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Juggernaut<\/b> - One player is randomly the Juggernaut, who has 200% damage resistance, twice the amount of shields (which cannot be recharged), immunity to assassinations, 50% faster speed, 50% greater jump height, three times the damage on melee attacks, and a Gravity Hammer with infinite ammo. However, they cannot use grenades, armor abilities, vehicles, or other weapons, and have a waypoint that everybody can see. New Juggernauts are invulnerable for 10 seconds. Killing an enemy gives the player 5 points, while killing an enemy as the Juggernaut gives the player 10 points. Players start with the Sprint ability, the Assault Rifle, the Magnum, and one frag grenade. There are no loadouts.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Territories (originated in Halo 2)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Territories<\/b> -<\/li><li><b>3-Plot Territories<\/b> -<\/li><li><b>Land Grab<\/b> -<\/li><\/ul><h3>Infection (originated in Halo 3)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Infection<\/b> - One player starts out as a Zombie (who has the Evade ability, an Energy Sword with double damage, no shields, an enhanced motion tracker that shows enemies at all times, 20% faster speed, 50% greater jump height, and cannot use vehicles) while the rest starts out with a Shotgun and a Magnum. Everybody has unlimited ammo, but cannot pick up weapons or use grenades. Once a Zombie kills a normal player, that normal player respawns as a Zombie. The last man standing has 50% more shields and 10% faster speed, but his location is visible to everybody else. Players who survive after four minutes gets an extra point.<\/li><li><b>Safe Havens<\/b> - Same as Infection, only there is now a special area on the map that, when normal players step into it, makes these normal players invulnerable. 15 seconds after a normal player steps on the special area, it moves to a random location on the map.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Headhunter (new)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Headhunter<\/b> - Killing an enemy causes a flaming skull to pop out of their head (as well as the skulls they previously collected). Players must collect these skulls (unlike Oddball, they are automatically carried) and run to one of two special \"Drop Points\". After 30 seconds, a new random location for each drop point is chosen. Players that are carrying skulls have a waypoint (which also has the number of skulls collected) that is visible to everybody. Players who capture the maximum amount of skulls (ten) automatically wins the game, regardless of the current scoreboard. Active Camo is replaced with Jet Pack.<\/li><li><b>Headhunter Pro<\/b> - A mixture of Headhunter and Slayer Pro. Only headshot kills generate collectable skulls.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Stockpile (new)<\/h3><ul><li><b>Stockpile<\/b> - 2-4 teams fight for four neutral flags that appear randomly throughout the map. Players must grab these flags and drop them off at designated control points. After each minute, all the flags in each team's control points are collected, giving them one point per flag. Players can also sabotage enemy control points and throw flags out of their points.<\/li><li><b>Stockpile Pro<\/b> (not included)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Invasion (new)<\/h3><ul><li><strong>Invasion -<\/strong> Invasion pits Spartans versus Elites in a multi-tiered attack-and-defend style mode. Each map is structured largely the same, with territories to capture in order to unlock the next section of the map before retrieving and escaping with a data core. In a nutshell its a game of \"territories, territories and finally CTF\". After a round is over, the teams switches side, alternating between attacking and defending.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Invasion Slayer -<\/strong> Invasion slayer plays very differently. Here, Spartans and Elites vie for control over territories that when captured will spawn that team a new vehicle or <em>\"Power Weapon\"<\/em>. As the match progresses, more loadouts will be unlocked and the team that reaches 100 kills first wins. The second and third tier are unlocked at 25 and 50 kills respectively.<\/li><li><strong>Invasion: Boneyard -<\/strong> The Elites are on offense, trying to steal a datacore from a defunct UNSC military installation. The campaign mission <em>\"Pillar of Autumn\"<\/em> is loosely based on Boneyard.<\/li><li><strong>Invasion: Spire -<\/strong> The Spartans are on offense, trying to gain access to a large energy sphere and stealing a datacore. The campaign mission <em>\"Tip of the Spear\"<\/em> is very much based on Spire.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Firefight<\/h2><p style=\"\"><a href=\"\/firefight\/3015-5869\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5869\">Firefight<\/a> returns in Reach from its introduction in Halo 3: ODST with a wealth of new options and features. The core concept remains the same, that being a set number of players fight against waves of AI enemies with increased difficulty through difficulty modifiers. The additions to Reach come in the form of improved matchmaking and network support, instead of the invite only nature of ODST. Furthermore, Firefight has been given a overhaul in terms of customization, allowing the user to tweak the mode to their liking. The player can change a multitude of options such as the weapon drops, types of enemies, the way in the which the enemies behave, and much more. The addition of new types of objective-based gametypes inside of Firefight adds more variety as well, such as the Generator Defense gametype (seen in the multiplayer beta) asks the players to defend a number of generators against Covenant forces.<\/p><p style=\"\">There is also the newly announced Versus Firefight which is a 2v2 gametype. 2 players are Spartans and there goal is to score as many points as possible in the allotted time frame, with a set number of lives. The other 2 players plays as Elites with Covenant reinforcements being dropped off just like regular Firefight, the Elite players' job is to kill the Spartans as fast as possible. The Elites score no points and have infinite lives to kill the Spartans, however the Spartans gain an extra life and point boost every time they kill one of the Elite's. When the round ends team switch sides and whoever scores the most points wins the game.<\/p><h3>Firefight Maps<\/h3><ul><li><b>Beachhead<\/b> - Set in a natural park in the metropolitan city of New Alexandria, on the planet Reach.<\/li><li><b>Corvette -<\/b> Set inside a Covenant cruiser in orbit above Reach, the combat on the map is focused inside a hangar bay.<\/li><li><b>Courtyard<\/b> - Wage war in a Courtyard outside an ONI building on Reach. Walkways, connecting rooms and plenty of cover make this a frantic space to fight in. It may not prove to be an effective weapon but feel free to jump behind the wheel of a Forklift if you feel inclined.<\/li><li><b>Glacier<\/b> - This map has been added in the latest patch. Glacier is an underground level where you defend the base from Covenant troops.<\/li><li><b>Holdout<\/b> <b>- Set in the outside of an industrial factory, Holdout is a multi tiered level where you defend against the Covenant .<\/b><\/li><li><b>Outpost<\/b> - Set affront a massive Covenant AA gun.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Overlook<\/b> - Fight against the Covenant in this settler dwelling set amidst the rugged Reach countryside.

It was the first Firefight map revealed during <a href=\"\">E3 2010<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Language on Reach<\/h2><p style=\"\">Occasionally citizens on Reach can be heard speaking a foreign language.

The game sets the players in a partially open city with the goal of finding and investigating the last known locations of your four ODST squad-mates while fighting off the Covenant forces in the area. Once you reach one of the last-known waypoints of a teammate, you discover an object related to the events they've been through--such as a ruined <a href=\"\/sniper-rifle\/3055-67\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle<\/a> hanging from a street light--and enter a flashback to earlier that day, where you control the squad member for an entire level. Through these 30-minute or so flashbacks (which play more like traditional, linear, Halo levels) you discover the fate of your teammate and unravel the mystery of the events that occurred in New Mombasa. The New Mombasa \" <a href=\"\/open-world\/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world<\/a>\" is comparable in function to the <a href=\"\/hub-world\/3015-1855\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1855\">hub world<\/a> from a platformer. Although the city in Halo 3: ODST is fairly large, its design and structure is not to be compared with that of <a href=\"\/liberty-city\/3035-15\" data-ref-id=\"3035-15\">Liberty City<\/a> from <a href=\"\/grand-theft-auto\/3025-6\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\">Grand Theft Auto<\/a> or other traditional sandbox-style <a href=\"\/open-world\/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world games<\/a>, given that there is no purpose to the hub world other than the story missions. The impact the city's look has and the time difference between flashback sequences and the Rookie's seemingly hopeless current situation are big parts of the game. Because the Rookie is shorter than the <a href=\"\/master-chief\/3005-175\" data-ref-id=\"3005-175\">Master Chief<\/a>'s towering 7' height, all enemies and vehicles seem slightly larger. The <a href=\"\/heads-up-display\/3015-180\" data-ref-id=\"3015-180\">heads-up display<\/a> is different from previous games since the player views the world from inside a standard-issue ODST helmet instead of a suit of <a href=\"..\/..\/mjolnir-armor\/93-33\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mjolnir armor<\/a> or a <a href=\"\/elites\/3015-470\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Sangheili<\/a> war harness.<\/p><p style=\"\">In addition to the new progression method, players have some new tools at their fingertips:<\/p><ul><li>A silenced <a href=\"\/m7-smg\/3055-126\" data-ref-id=\"3055-126\">M7 SMG<\/a> and a silenced <a href=\"\/m6c-magnum\/3055-2807\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2807\">magnum pistol<\/a>, allowing them to move about the city surreptitiously.

At the time, Halo was going to be a simultaneous Mac and Windows release. Prior to MacWorld Halo had only been viewed behind closed doors by journalists who were required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. At this point Halo was intended to be a third-person-action game, in which a ship crash lands on a ring world and early versions of the <a href=\"\/the-covenant\/3015-81\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">Covenant<\/a> aliens appear simply to loot what they can with the humans forced to resort to guerrilla warfare.<\/p><p style=\"\">The first official trailer was shown at E3 2000 and was well received. One month later on June 19th 2000 Microsoft announced that it had acquired Bungie Studios; Halo had become an Xbox exclusive. Bungie rewrote the game's engine and the game became a first person shooter. Playable demos carried mixed reactions up to its release simultaneously with the Xbox on November 15th, 2001.<\/p><h3>Remake<\/h3><p style=\"\">At E3 2011, it was announced that on November 15th, 2011, exactly ten years after the release of the original Halo game, which went on to spawn one of the most popular video-game franchises of all time, the new holders of the legal rights to the franchise would be releasing a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved for the <a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a>, featuring an identical game engine but bleeding-edge graphics layered over it.

Humans, under the United Nations Space Command ( <a href=\"\/unsc\/3015-3859\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3859\">UNSC<\/a>) have harnessed faster-than-light \"Slipspace\" travel and have colonized hundreds of planets in solar systems across the galaxy. During the Human expansion, they encounter an alliance of alien species, called <a href=\"\/the-covenant\/3015-81\" data-ref-id=\"3015-81\">the Covenant<\/a>, who are inexplicably intent on the complete eradication of Humankind from the galaxy. Fortunately, the UNSC had previously created a <a href=\"\/super-soldier\/3015-90\" data-ref-id=\"3015-90\">supersoldier<\/a> program to deal with terrorists, labelling the genetically-modified subjects \" <a href=\"\/spartan\/3015-666\" data-ref-id=\"3015-666\">Spartans<\/a>,\" and equipping the super soldiers with a suit of power armour made of the most cutting edge technology available, that was soon made even more formidable with the addition of <a href=\"\/energy-force-shield\/3055-644\" data-ref-id=\"3055-644\">energy shields<\/a> based on stolen Covenant technology.<\/p><p style=\"\">In August of 2552, the Covenant find the planet <a href=\"\/reach\/3035-571\" data-ref-id=\"3035-571\">Reach<\/a>, a major Human military stronghold, the second-most well protected planet after Earth herself, and assault the planet with a massive fleet. Reach falls, and most of the Spartans are lost in the battle.

The Pillar of Autumn falls out of Slipspace several weeks later in an unknown quadrant of space, unable to contact any other UNSC forces.

The Covenant, however, withhold bombarding the Autumn with plasma weapons so close to the ring, and instead deploy infantry to board the cruiser. Just before the Covenant's arrival on-board, the Master Chief is awakened from cryo-sleep, from which he makes his way to the bridge, where Captain Keyes gives him his pistol. Keyes's plan is to crash-land the Autumn on the habitable ringworld. Before leaving, the Master Chief takes the chip that contains Cortana and inserts the chip into his MJOLNIR suit in order to prevent her from falling into Covenant hands. Together, the Master Chief and Cortana make their way through the quickly-deteriorating Autumn, toward the ship's escape pods, where the remaining marines on-board have prepared for evacuation. The Master Chief enters a escape pod, and it jettisons from the Pillar of Autumn as the cruiser careens into the atmosphere of the ring.<\/p><h3>Halo \/ Truth and Reconciliation \/ The Silent Cartographer<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345408\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345408-17screenshot00_10.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Halo<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Master Chief's escape pod crash-lands onto the ring, killing all the marines within and knocking the Master Chief unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the Master Chief learns that other pods have landed safely within the vicinity and Cortana intercepts Covenant chatter revealing that the Covenant have seized the wreckage of the Autumn and have captured Captain Keyes himself, holding him prisoner aboard the Covenant ship Truth and Reconciliation. Collecting what is left of the UNSC Marines, the Master Chief, <a href=\"\/sergeant-major-avery-junior-johnson\/3005-964\" data-ref-id=\"3005-964\">Sergeant Avery Johnson<\/a>, and dropship pilot Carol Rawley (known in-game by her callsign \"Foe Hammer\") make a push for the Truth and Reconciliation, where they plan to rescue Keyes from capture. Upon meeting up with him again, Captain Keyes reveals that he has learned through eavesdropping on his captor's conversations that the Covenant call the ringworld \" <a href=\"\/halo\/3035-58\" data-ref-id=\"3035-58\">Halo<\/a>,\" and that they deem it not only as a religious relic, but as a powerful superweapon, one with enough influence to give its manipulator the power to control the galaxy. Cortana remarks she had intercepted several transmissions referring to a \"control room,\" and that she assumed the Covenant were looking for a control room to a cruiser damaged in the battle above the ring. Instead, the Covenant are actually looking for Halo's control center. Cortana believes that the Humans can get there first if she can interface with a local mapping station referred to by the Covenant as the \"Silent Cartographer\".<\/p><p style=\"\">Committed to stopping the Covenant before they find the Control Room, and reinvigorated after the successful invasion of the Truth and Reconciliation, the marines on Halo begin a large-scale assault for the Silent Cartographer. In the meantime, Keyes gains information regarding the location of a large Covenant weapons cache. Believing he and a group of marines led by Sergeant Johnson can seize the cache, he leaves to make his way there, without the Master Chief, who is sent to find and operate the Silent Cartographer. The Chief is successful in this mission, and learns the location of the Control Room, as Keyes and Johnson close in on the weapons cache, deep inside a dense jungle several hundred miles away from the Cartographer island.<\/p><h3>Assault on the Control Room \/ 343 Guilty Spark<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345421\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345421-4wiki.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345421-4wiki.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Assault on the Control Room<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Foe Hammer brings the Master Chief and Cortana as close as she can to the Control Room, where the Master Chief makes a push through heavy Covenant resistance--the heaviest yet seen on Halo--for the Control Room, which is a vast chamber with a holographic Halo rotating around the perimeter and central platform. Upon reaching the Control Room (and locking the Covenant out of it), the Master Chief removes Cortana's chip and uploads her into the terminal. She exclaims that the wealth of information is nearly intoxicating, even for an AI like herself, and mentions that an ancient alien race called the <a href=\"\/the-forerunner\/3015-80\" data-ref-id=\"3015-80\">Forerunners<\/a> built an array of Halos just like this one, millions of years ago. And as she uncovers this information, she stops abruptly. Horrified by something unknown to the Master Chief, she orders him to find Keyes and to stop him from opening the weapons cache \"before it is too late.\"<\/p><p style=\"\">Leaving Cortana in the locked Control Room, the Master Chief and Foe Hammer hurry for the jungle. Once in the jungle, beneath the fog and foliage canopy, the Chief finds corpses of Covenant soldiers-- <a href=\"\/grunts\/3015-1331\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1331\">Grunts<\/a>, <a href=\"\/jackals\/3015-3379\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3379\">Jackals<\/a>, and even <a href=\"\/elites\/3015-470\" data-ref-id=\"3015-470\">Elites<\/a>--and an abandoned <a href=\"\/pelican\/3055-1038\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1038\">Pelican<\/a> dropship playing a looping distress message. Traversing the jungle, the Master Chief finds a facility nestled into the side of a bluff--the cache Keyes came to find. Inside the facility, the Chief finds little trace of Captain Keyes, Johnson, or the marines amongst the scattered and panicked Covenant troops and Covenant corpses, but finds massive amounts of alien blood splattering the walls, far more than would be created by being shot by Human weapons. Later, he comes across a single marine who appears to have lost his mind, shooting at anything that moves and telling \"those things\" to stay away from him, and that he won't let them get him. Deep within the facility, the Master Chief finds a heavy blast door locked from the outside by a UNSC tech-lock. Activating it, the Master Chief opens the door and finds a marine corpse slumped against the door. Another marine's helmet lies nearby on the ground, next to a large pool of blood. The Master Chief links up with the video feed from the missing marine's helmet, which shows Keyes and Johnson investigating the cache before being ambushed by a new, unidentified non-Covenant alien species. The video feed shows Keyes's group completely overrun by the pulpy creatures before the video ends abruptly, citing the marine's death as the cause for disruption.<\/p><p style=\"\">Moments after viewing the feed, the Master Chief is ambushed by a massive swarm of the small, pulpy aliens, now accompanied by larger Combat Forms. The Combat Forms resemble--and, indeed, are--rotting Covenant and Human corpses, now under the control of the smaller Infection Forms. Fighting his way out to the jungle, killing both former enemies and allies now controlled by the parasite, the Master Chief exits the facility on the far side of the bluff, and is assisted by a number of airborne robots of unknown origin, armed with powerful laser weaponry that seems to be perfectly designed to destroy the mutated creatures. The leader of the robots (which are known as Sentinels) teleports the Master Chief to a raised position atop a gigantic tower, and introduces himself as <a href=\"\/343-guilty-spark\/3005-1190\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1190\">343 Guilty Spark<\/a>, the Monitor of Installation Zero-Four (the Forerunner term for this specific Halo, as there are seven total). Spark exclaims that someone--the Covenant, who he calls an impatient and overzealous group of aliens--has released <a href=\"\/the-flood\/3015-645\" data-ref-id=\"3015-645\">the Flood<\/a>, the parasitic lifeform now rampant upon the soil of Halo. Calling the Master Chief a \"Reclaimer,\" the Monitor states the only way to stop the Flood is to activate Halo itself, a task for which they require the Index, a Forerunner tech-key located within a tower called the Library.<\/p><h3>The Library \/ Two Betrayals<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345425\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345425-halo_flood_forms_library.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Master Chief fighting off The Flood in \"The Library\"<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The Monitor escorts the Master Chief through myriad waves of Flood Combat Forms, commenting that that the Chief's weapons are highly ineffective against the Flood, and makes several comments regarding the Master Chief's lack of preparedness for Flood containment protocols. On the way, Guilty Spark mentions that the Flood are contained on Halo for study, and that, in the case that the Flood escape Halo, they would consume all sentient life in the galaxy. Once at the Index, the Monitor absorbs the key's data, and teleports both himself and the Master Chief back to the Control Room.<\/p><p style=\"\">When the pair arrive at Halo's Control Room, Cortana reappears in the terminal just as the Master Chief inserts the Index to activate the ring's weaponry. She impedes the process and uses her command of the ringworld's systems to temporarily disable the Monitor. Cortana derides the Master Chief for falling in step with Spark without knowing the full capability of Halo's power. \"Halo doesn't kill the Flood,\" Cortana explains, \"it kills their food. Human, Covenant, whatever. We're all equally edible.\"<\/p><p style=\"\">The Chief questions the Monitor, who seems strangely confused that the Master Chief was ignorant to this knowledge--as though he should have known this before. When Cortana absorbs the Index's data and is reinserted into the MJOLNIR armor, the Monitor summons a squad of Sentinels to attack the Master Chief, who now fights a war on three fronts--Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels. Cortana and the Master Chief escape, and Cortana--having completely assimilated the vast breadth of Halo's information--tells the Master Chief that the only way to guarantee Halo cannot be fired, which would trigger the rest of the rings in the array and thus destroy all sentient life in the galaxy, is to destroy it entirely, and that the only way to destroy Halo is to detonate the fusion core inside the wreckage of the Pillar of Autumn, and that the only way to detonate the Autumn's core is with a special set of passcodes contained in a chip implanted in the brain of Captain Keyes. Therefore, he must be rescued at all costs.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Master Chief destroys the three generators powering the majority of Halo's central functions, buying enough time for Cortana to find Keyes before the Monitor can reboot the ring's arsenal. With that done, she determines that Keyes--alive or dead--is on-board the now Flood-controlled Truth and Reconciliation.<\/p><h3>Keyes \/ The Maw<\/h3><p style=\"\">Cortana manages to transport them to the Truth and Reconciliation via a teleportation tactic similar to that which the Monitor uses. Immediately, Keyes, sounding pained and on the verge of death, radios the Master Chief to turn back, to leave Halo by any means possible. The Flood, having completely overrun the ship, gather piles of Covenant corpses in the two largest rooms for some unknown purpose (later entries in the series imply that this was in preparation for the construction of a <a href=\"\/gravemind\/3005-996\" data-ref-id=\"3005-996\">Gravemind<\/a>). And as the Chief makes his way toward Keyes, he learns that the Flood are repairing the Truth and Reconciliation, planning to leave Halo in order to consume more sentient life. The Chief finds Keyes, but finds him too late. Keyes is totally consumed by the Flood and has been absorbed into a large, fleshy growth of Flood tissue. Cortana remarks that Keyes wanted them to leave by any means possible, and the Master Chief obliges, punching his hand into the softened skull of the deceased captain, physically removing the chip from within. Black-armored Covenant special operatives arrive on the ship to thwart the Flood threat, and they are distraction enough for the Master Chief to hijack a Covenant <a href=\"\/banshee\/3055-374\" data-ref-id=\"3055-374\">Banshee<\/a> and escape the Truth and Reconciliation.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60997\/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60997\/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1738248\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/60997\/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/60997\/1738248-crashlanding.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Master Chief climbs onto the Pillar of Autumn<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">As the sun rises on Halo, the Master Chief's Banshee reaches the Autumn, which has already been occupied by Flood and Sentinel forces since the Flood incursion. At the Autumn's bridge, Cortana uses Keyes's chip to activate the self-destruct sequence, but it is stopped by the Monitor, who has taken full control of the ship's remaining functional systems. Although Cortana has finally run out of ideas, the Chief suggests they do it the old fashioned way: damage the fusion core using grenades or rockets, rendering it unstable to the point where detonation becomes inevitable.<\/p><p style=\"\">The Master Chief fights through waves of Covenant, Flood, and Sentinels, all assaulting each other as well as the lone Spartan, who appears to be one of the only Humans left alive on Halo. After detonating the four reactors, the Chief successfully damages the fusion core and starts the inevitable chain reaction. Foe Hammer, having survived the Flood infection in her Pelican, tells the Master Chief to grab a Warthog from the vehicle depot and meet her at a landing pad just under a kilometer down the length of the ship, where she can extract him and Cortana and escape the destruction of Halo. Driving over Flood forms and dodging Sentinel laser cannons and Covenant plasma fire, the Chief makes it to the landing pad with minutes to spare, but Foe Hammer is ambushed by a pair of Covenant Banshees, and her Pelican crashes and explodes.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4586\/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1345429\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4586\/1345429-scrn_006.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The crashed PIllar of Autumn in the final level \"The Maw\"<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">With no time to mourn their most recently slain friend, the Master Chief and Cortana make one final charge: a Longsword starfighter is docked at the far end of the ship, and if they can make it there in time, they can use it to escape Halo. Seconds before the Autumn detonates, the Chief boards the Longsword and flees the ring, managing to get to a safe distance just before the nuclear reaction creates a shockwave whose power is enough to shatter Halo entirely, sending massive, concave shards careening through space. The Chief uses the Longsword's sensors to search the debris field, hoping that other UNSC marines escaped the ring before its destruction. But there is nothing left but dust and echoes.<\/p><p style=\"\">Cortana states that with Halo and the Covenant fleet destroyed, everything is finished, hinting at a sense of optimism.

It differs from most others at the time in the damage system, you have the standard health bar with eight bars which decrease if you're hit while your shields have failed (can be replenished with health packs). As opposed to picking up an \"armor power up\" the player always has shields which slowly take damage when hit like a secondary health bar, if hit enough they fail and your health begins to decrease, and if you keep your head down long enough they recharge. Halo made this style of health regeneration popular within many games made today, and this reason is one of many of why Halo was so revolutionary. Along with popularizing health regeneration Halo also popularized restricting the player to only carrying two weapons at a time, simultaneously solving the problem of cycling through large numbers of weapons on a console pad and forcing developers to make every weapon \"count\", as the pistol could no longer be a near-useless weapon of last resort, for example. It is also remembered for its extremely tight controls which made it the first great feeling FPS, on the console.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1326\/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204106\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.53\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1326\/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204106\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1326\/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1326\/204106-w_rocketlauncher.jpg\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>SPNKr Rocket Launcher<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">The weapons are separated into two categories, Covenant and Human.

The PC port added real online multiplayer to the game, multiplayer Banshees, and an additional six maps created from scratch by <a href=\"\/gearbox-software-llc\/3010-1615\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\">Gearbox<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Halo PC Exclusive Maps:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/danger-canyon\/3035-2861\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2861\">Danger Canyon<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/death-island\/3035-2862\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2862\">Death Island<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/gephyrophobia\/3035-2866\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2866\">Gephyrophobia<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/ice-fields\/3035-2865\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2865\">Ice Fields<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/infinity\/3035-2864\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2864\">Infinity<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/timberland\/3035-2863\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2863\">Timberland<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>Post-release<\/h2><p style=\"\">Halo: Combat Evolved gained a large community of fans through the internet and in the gaming media. It also inherited the Bungie fan community that already existed and gained many new fans due to its fantastic campaign mode and multiplayer matches. By connecting up to 4 Xbox consoles through System Link (with Ethernet cables and a router if necessary) Halo LAN parties made Halo: Combat Evolved a phenomenon. Players could play up to 16 player multiplayer matches while all being in the same location to trash talk and berate each other. A year after release Halo: Combat Evolved was already being played competitively in tournaments and online using legal tunneling software such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbconnect.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox Connect<\/a>. While Halo: Combat Evolved's gameplay was simple and straightforward, it has spawned a highly successful series with fans all over the world.<\/p><h3>Halo Custom Edition<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1140282\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 241px\" data-ratio=\"0.43983402489627\" data-width=\"241\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.0%\" href=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1140282-picture_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1140282\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1140282-picture_1.png\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1140282-picture_1.png\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Halo: Custom Edition<\/figcaption><\/figure><p style=\"\">Halo: Custom Edition is a free expansion that requires a key code from Halo: Combat Evolved to be played.
